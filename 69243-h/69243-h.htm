<h2 class="super">THE KABBALAH.</h2>
<h2 class="main">I.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A system of religious philosophy, or more properly of theosophy, which has not only
exercised for hundreds of years an extraordinary influence on the mental development
of so shrewd a people as the Jews, but has captivated the minds of some of the greatest
thinkers of Christendom in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, claims the greatest
attention of both the philosopher and the theologian. When it is added that among
its captives were Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic, metaphysician and chemist
(died 1315); John Reuchlin, the renowned scholar and reviver of oriental literature
in Europe (born 1455, died 1522); John Picus di Mirandola, the famous philosopher
and classical scholar (1463–1494); Cornelius Henry Agrippa, the distinguished philosopher,
divine and physician (1486–1535); John Baptist von Helmont, a remarkable chemist and
physician (1577–1644); as well as our own countrymen Robert Fludd, the famous physician
and philosopher (1574–1637), and Dr. Henry More (1614–1687); and that these men, after
restlessly searching for a scientific system which should disclose to them “the deepest
depths” of the Divine nature, and show them the real tie which binds all things together,
found the cravings of their minds satisfied by this theosophy, the claims of the Kabbalah
on the attention of students in literature and philosophy will readily be admitted.
The claims of the Kabbalah, however, are not restricted to the literary <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>man and the philosopher: the poet too will find in it ample materials for the exercise
of his lofty genius. How can it be otherwise with a theosophy which, we are assured,
was born of God in Paradise, was nursed and reared by the choicest of the angelic
hosts in heaven, and only held converse with the holiest of man’s children upon earth.
Listen to the story of its birth, growth and maturity, as told by its followers.
</p>
<p>The Kabbalah was first taught by God himself to a select company of angels, who formed
a theosophic school in Paradise. After the fall the angels most graciously communicated
this heavenly doctrine to the disobedient child of earth, to furnish the protoplasts
with the means of returning to their pristine nobility and felicity. From Adam it
passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, the friend of God, who emigrated with it
to Egypt, where the patriarch allowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze
out. It was in this way that the Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the
other Eastern nations could introduce it into their philosophical systems. Moses,
who was learned in all the wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated into it in the land
of his birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness,
when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole forty years, but received
lessons in it from one of the angels. By the aid of this mysterious science the lawgiver
was enabled to solve the difficulties which arose during his management of the Israelites,
in spite of the pilgrimages, wars and the frequent miseries of the nation. He covertly
laid down the principles of this secret doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch,
but withheld them from Deuteronomy. This constitutes the former the man, and the latter
the woman. Moses also initiated the seventy elders into the secrets of this doctrine,
and they again transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who formed the <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>unbroken line of tradition, David and Solomon were most initiated into the Kabbalah.
No one, however, dared to write it down, till Simon ben Jochai, who lived at the time
of the destruction of the second Temple. Having been condemned to death by Titus,
Rabbi Simon managed to escape with his son and concealed himself in a cavern where
he remained for twelve years. Here, in this subterranean abode, he occupied himself
entirely with the contemplation of the sublime Kabbalah, and was constantly visited
by the Prophet Elias, who disclosed to him some of its secrets which were still concealed
from the theosophical Rabbi. Here, too, his disciples resorted to be initiated by
their master into these divine mysteries; and here, Simon ben Jochai expired with
this heavenly doctrine in his mouth, whilst discoursing on it to his disciples. Scarcely
had his spirit departed, when a dazzling light filled the cavern, so that no one could
look at the Rabbi; whilst a burning fire appeared outside, forming as it were a sentinel
at the entrance of the cave, and denying admittance to the neighbours. It was not
till the light inside, and the fire outside, had disappeared, that the disciples perceived
that the lamp of Israel was extinguished. As they were preparing for his obsequies,
a voice was heard from heaven, saying, “Come ye to the marriage of Simon b. Jochai,
he is entering into peace, and shall rest in his chamber!” A flame preceded the coffin,
which seemed enveloped by, and burning like fire. And when the remains were deposited
in the tomb, another voice was heard from heaven, saying, “This is he who caused the
earth to quake, and the kingdoms to shake!” His son, R. Eliezer, and his secretary,
R. Abba, as well as his disciples, then collated R. Simon b. Jochai’s treatises, and
out of these composed the celebrated work called <i>Sohar</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זהר‎</span>) <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Splendour</i>, which is the grand storehouse of Kabbalism.
</p>
<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that the followers <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>of this secret doctrine claim for it a pre-Adamite existence, and maintain that, ever
since the creation of the first man, it has been received uninterruptedly from the
hands of the patriarchs, the prophets, &amp;c. It is for this reason that it is called
<i>Kabbalah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלה‎</span> from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבל‎</span> <i>to receive</i>) which primarily denotes <i>reception</i>, and then <i>a doctrine received by oral tradition</i>. The Kabbalah is also called by some <i>Secret Wisdom</i>. (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה נסתרה‎</span>), because it was only handed down by tradition through the initiated, and is indicated
in the Hebrew Scriptures by signs which are hidden and unintelligible to those who
have not been instructed in its mysteries. From the initial letters of this name,
this theosophic system is also denominated <i>Grace</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ח״ן‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה נסתרה‎</span>). Vague and indefinite as this name may seem to the uninitiated, inasmuch as it conveys
no idea whatever of the peculiar doctrines of the system, but simply indicates the
manner in which they have been transmitted, it is nevertheless the classical and acknowledged
appellation of this theosophy. The difference between the word <i>Kabbalah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלה‎</span> <i>receptio</i>) and the cognate term <i>Massorah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מסורה‎</span> <i>traditio</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מסר‎</span> <i>to transmit</i>)—which denotes <i>the traditionally transmitted</i> various readings of the Hebrew Scriptures—is, that the former expresses <i>the act of receiving</i>, which in this technical sense could only be on the part of one who has reached a
certain period of life, as well as a certain state of sanctity, implying also a degree
of secrecy; whilst the latter signifies <i>the act of giving over, surrendering</i>, without premising any peculiar age, stage of holiness, or degree of secrecy. The
name, therefore, tells us no more than that this theosophy has been received traditionally.
To ascertain its tenets we must analyze the system itself or the books which propound
it; and to this task we now betake ourselves.
</p>
<p>The cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah are mainly designed to solve the grand problems
about (I) The nature of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>Supreme Being, (II) The cosmogony, (III) The creation of angels and man, (IV) The
destiny of man and the universe, and (V) To point out the import of the Revealed Law.
Assenting and consenting to the declarations of the Hebrew Scriptures about the unity
of God ( Exod. xx, 3 ; Deut. iv, 35, 39 ; vi, 4 ; xxxii, 39 ), his incorporeity ( Exod. xx, 4 ; Deut. iv, 15 ; Ps. xiv, 18 ), eternity ( Exod. iii, 14 ; Deut. xxxii, 40 ; Isa. xli, 4 ; xliii, 10 ; xliv, 6 ; xlviii, 12 ), immutability ( Mal. iii, 6 ), perfection ( Deut. xxxii, 4 ; 2 Sam. xxii, 31 ; Job xxxviii, 16 ; Ps. xviii, 31 ), infinite goodness ( Exod. xxxiv, 6 ; Ps. xxv, 10 ; xxxiii, 5 ; c, 5 ; cxlv, 9 ), the creation of the world in time according to God’s free will ( Gen. i, 1 ), the moral government of the universe and special providence, and to the creation
of man in the image of God ( Gen. i. 27 ), the Kabbalah seeks to explain the transition from the infinite to the finite; the
procedure of multifariousness from an absolute unity, and of matter from a pure intelligence;
the operation of pure intelligence upon matter, in spite of the infinite gulf between
them; the relationship of the Creator to the creature, so as to be able to exercise
supervision and providence. It, moreover, endeavours to show how it is that the Bible
gives names and assigns attributes and a form to so spiritual a Being; how the existence
of evil is compatible with the infinite goodness of God, and what is the Divine intention
about this creation.
</p>
<p>In our analysis of the Kabbalistic doctrines on these grand problems, we shall follow
the order in which they have been enumerated, and accordingly begin with the lucubrations
on the Supreme Being and the Emanations.
</p>
<p>I. <i>The Supreme Being and the doctrine and classification of the Emanations, or Sephiroth.</i>
</p>
<p>Being boundless in his nature—which necessarily implies that he is an absolute unity
and inscrutable, and that there <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>is nothing without him, or that the <span class="trans" title="to pan"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὸ πᾶν</span></span> is in him,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e376src" href="#xd31e376">1</a>—God is called <span class="sc">En Soph</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>) = <span class="trans" title="apeiros"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e455" title="Source: ἄπείρος">ἄπειρος</span></span></span> <i>Endless</i>, <i>Boundless</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e468src" href="#xd31e468">2</a> In this boundlessness, or as <i>the En Soph</i>, he cannot be comprehended by the intellect, nor described in words, for there is
nothing which can grasp and depict him to us, and as such he is, in a certain sense,
not existent (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַיִן‎</span>), because, as far as our minds are concerned, that which is perfectly incomprehensible
does not exist.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e488src" href="#xd31e488">3</a> To make his existence perceptible, and to render himself comprehensible, <i>the En Soph</i>, or <i>the Boundless</i>, had to become active and creative. But <i>the En Soph</i> cannot be the direct creator, for he has neither will, intention, desire, thought,
language, nor action, as these properties imply limit and belong to finite beings,
whereas <i>the En Soph</i> is boundless. Besides, the imperfect and circumscribed nature of the creation precludes
the idea that the world was created or even designed by him, who can have no will
nor produce anything but what is like himself, boundless and <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>perfect. On the other hand, again, the beautiful design displayed in the mechanism,
the regular order manifested in the preservation, destruction, and renewal of things,
forbid us to regard this world as the offspring of chance, and constrain us to recognize
therein an intelligent design.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e506src" href="#xd31e506">4</a> We are, therefore, compelled to view <i>the En Soph</i> as the creator of the world in <i>an indirect manner</i>.
</p>
<p>Now, <i>the medium</i> by which <i>the En Soph</i> made his existence known in the creation of the world are ten <i>Sephiroth</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e531src" href="#xd31e531">5</a> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספירות‎</span>) or <i>intelligences</i>, which emanated from the Boundless One (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>) in the following manner:—At first <i>the En Soph</i>, or <i>the Aged of the Aged</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עתיקא דעתיקין‎</span>) or <i>the Holy Aged</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עתיקא קדישא‎</span>), as he is alternately called, sent forth from his infinite light one spiritual substance
or intelligence. This first <i>Sephira</i>, which existed in <i>the En Soph</i> from all eternity, and became a reality by a mere act, has no less than seven appellations.
It is called—I, <i>the Crown</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>), because it occupies the highest position; II, <i>the Aged</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עתיקא‎</span>), because it is the oldest or the first emanation—and this name must not be confounded
with <i>the Aged of the Aged</i>, which, as we have seen, is the appellation of <i>the En Soph</i>; III, <i>the Primordial Point</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נקודה ראשונה‎</span>), or <i>the Smooth Point</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נקודה פשוטה‎</span>), because, as the <i>Sohar</i> tells us, “When the Concealed of the Concealed wished to reveal himself, he first
made a single <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>point: the Infinite was entirely unknown, and diffused no light before this luminous
point violently broke through into vision;” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 15 <i>a</i>). IV, <i>the White Head</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רישא הוורה‎</span>); V, <i>the Long Face, Macroprosopon</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אריך אנפין‎</span>), because the whole ten <i>Sephiroth</i> represent the Primordial or the Heavenly Man (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדם עילאה‎</span>), of which the first <i>Sephira</i> is the head; VI, <i>The Inscrutable Height</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רום מעלה‎</span>), because it is the highest of all the <i>Sephiroth</i> proceeding immediately from <i>the En Soph</i>. Hence, on the passage “Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold the King of
Peace<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e712src" href="#xd31e712">6</a> with the Crown!” ( Song of Solomon iii, 2 ) the <i>Sohar</i> remarks, “But who can behold the King of Peace, seeing that He is incomprehensible,
even to the heavenly hosts? But he who sees the Crown sees the glory of the King of
Peace.” (<i>Sohar</i> ii. 100 <i>b</i>.) And, VII, it is expressed in the Bible by the Divine name <i>Ehejeh</i>, or <i>I Am</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהיה‎</span> Exod. iii, 4 ), because it is absolute being, representing the Infinite as distinguished from the
finite, and in the angelic order, by the celestial beasts of Ezekiel, called <i>Chajoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיות‎</span>). The first <i>Sephira</i> contained the other nine <i>Sephiroth</i>, and gave rise to them in the following order:—At first a masculine or active potency,
designated <i>Wisdom</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>), proceeded from it. This <i>Sephira</i>, which among the divine names is represented by <i>Jah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יה‎</span> Isa. xxvi, 4 ), and among the angelic hosts by <i>Oplianim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אפנים‎</span> <i>Wheels</i>), sent forth an opposite, <i>i.e.</i> a feminine or passive, potency, denominated <i>Intelligence</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>), which is represented by the divine name <i>Jehovah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>), and angelic name <i>Arelim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אראלים‎</span>), and it is from a union of these two <i>Sephiroth</i>, which are also called <i>Father</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבא‎</span>) and <i>Mother</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמא‎</span>), that the remaining seven <i>Sephiroth</i> proceeded. Or, as the <i>Sohar</i> (iii, 290 <i>a</i>) expresses it, “When the Holy Aged, <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>the Concealed of all Concealed, assumed a form, he produced everything in the form
of male and female, as the things could not continue in any other form. Hence Wisdom,
which is the beginning of development, when it proceeded from the Holy Aged, emanated
in male and female, for Wisdom expanded, and Intelligence proceeded from it, and thus
obtained male and female—viz., Wisdom, the father, and Intelligence, the mother, from
whose union the other pairs of <i>Sephiroth</i> successively emanated.” These two opposite potencies—viz., Wisdom (<span class="corr" id="xd31e821" title="Source: ‏הכמה‎"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span></span>) and Intelligence (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>)—are joined together by the first potency, the Crown (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>); thus yielding the first triad of the <i>Sephiroth</i>.
</p>
<p>From the junction of the foregoing opposites emanated again the masculine or active
potency, denominated <i>Mercy</i> or <i>Love</i>, (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד‎</span>), also called <i>Greatness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גדולה‎</span>), the fourth <i>Sephira</i>, which among the divine names is represented by <i>El</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל‎</span>), and among the angelic hosts by <i>Chashmalim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חשמלים‎</span>, Comp. Ezek. i, 4 ). From this again emanated the feminine or passive potency, <i>Justice</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דין‎</span>), also called <i>Judicial Power</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גבורה‎</span>), the fifth <i>Sephira</i>, which is represented by the divine name <i>Eloha</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span>), and among the angels by <i>Seraphim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שרפים‎</span>, Isa. vi, 6 ); and from this again the uniting potency, <i>Beauty</i> or <i>Mildness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), the sixth <i>Sephira</i>, represented by the divine name <i>Elohim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים‎</span>), and among the angels by <i>Shinanim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שנאנים‎</span>, Ps. lxviii, 18 ). Since without this union the existence of things would not be possible, inasmuch
as mercy not tempered with justice, and justice not tempered with mercy would be unendurable:
and thus the second trinity of the <i>Sephiroth</i> is obtained.
</p>
<p>The medium of union of the second trinity, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Beauty</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), the sixth <i>Sephira</i>, beamed forth the masculine or active potency, <i>Firmness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נצח‎</span>), the seventh <i>Sephira</i>, corresponding to the divine name <i>Jehovah Sabaoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה צבאות‎</span>), and among the angels to <i>Tarshishim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תרשישים‎</span>, Dan. x, 6 ); <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>this again gave rise to the feminine or passive potency, <i>Splendour</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוד‎</span>), the eighth <i>Sephira</i>, to which answer the divine name <i>Elohim Sabaoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים צבאות‎</span>), and among the angels <i>Benei Elohim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בני אלהים‎</span>, Gen. vi, 4 ); and from it again, emanated <i>Foundation</i> or <i>the Basis</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>), the ninth <i>Sephira</i>, represented by the divine name <i>El Chai</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל חי‎</span>), and among the angelic hosts by <i>Ishim</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd31e994" title="Source: ‏אשים‎"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אישים‎</span></span>, Ps. civ, 4 ), which is the uniting point between these two opposites—thus yielding the third
trinity of <i>Sephiroth</i>. From the ninth <i>Sephira, the Basis</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>) of all, emanated the tenth, called <i>Kingdom</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות‎</span>), and <i>Shechinah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שכינה‎</span>), which is represented by the divine name <i>Adonai</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדוני‎</span>), and among the angelic hosts by <i>Cherubim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כרובים‎</span>). The table on the opposite page exhibits the different names of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, together with the several names of God and the angels, which correspond to them.
</p>
<p>From this representation of each triad, as consisting of a threefold principle, viz.,
the two opposites, masculine and feminine, and the uniting principle, the development
of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and of life generally, is symbolically called <i>the Balance</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתקלא‎</span>), because the two opposite sexes, are compared with the two opposite scales, and
the uniting <i>Sephira</i> is compared with the beam which joins the scales, and indicates its equipoise.
</p>
<p>Before we enter into further particulars about the nature, operation, and classification
of these <i>Sephiroth</i>, we shall give the <i>Sohar’s</i> speculations about the Supreme Being, and its account of the origin of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and their relationship to the Deity.

<p>The prophet Elias having learned in the heavenly college the profound mystery and
true import of the words in Isa. xl, 25, 26 , “To whom will ye liken me, and shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your
eyes on high, and behold who (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מי‎</span>) hath created these things (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span>),” revealed to R. Simon b. Jochai that God in his absolute nature is unknown <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>and incomprehensible, and hence, in a certain sense, non-existent; that this <i>Who</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span> <i>unknown subject</i>) had to become active and creative, to demonstrate his existence, and that it is
only by these (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span>) works of creation that he made himself known to us. It is therefore the combination
of the unknown <i>Who</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מי‎</span>) with <i>these visible</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span>) works that showed him to be God (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים‎</span> which is produced by <span class="corr" id="xd31e1646" title="Source: ‏מ‎"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מי‎</span></span> transposed, <i>i.e.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יﬦ‎</span>, and united with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span>). Or, as it is in the language of the Kabbalah;—
</p>
<p>“Before he gave any shape to this world, before he produced any form, he was alone,
without a form and resemblance to anything else. Who then can comprehend him how he
was before the creation, since he was formless? Hence it is forbidden to represent
him by any form, similitude, or even by his sacred name, by a single letter or a single
point; and to this the words ‘Ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord
spake unto you’ ( Deut. iv, 15 )—<i>i.e.</i> ye have not seen anything which you could represent by any form or likeness—refer.
But after he created the form of <i>the Heavenly Man</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדם עלאה‎</span>), he used it as a chariot (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מרכבה‎</span>) wherein to descend, and wishes to be called by this form, which is the sacred name
Jehovah. He wishes to be known by his attributes, and each attribute separately; and
therefore had himself called the God of Mercy, the God of Justice, Almighty, God of
Sabaoth, and the Being. He wishes thereby to make known his nature, and that we should
see how his mercy and compassion extend both to the world and to all operations. For
if he had not poured out his light upon all his creatures, how could we ever have
known him? How could the words be fulfilled, ‘The whole earth is full of his glory’
( Isa. vi, 3 )? Woe be to him who compares him with his own attributes! or still worse with the
son of man whose foundation is in the dust, who vanishes and is no more! Hence, the
form in which we delineate him simply describes <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>each time his dominion over a certain attribute, or over the creatures generally.
We cannot understand more of his nature than the attribute expresses. Hence, when
he is divested of all these things, he has neither any attribute nor any similitude
or form. The form in which he is generally depicted is to be compared to a very expansive
sea; for the waters of the sea are in themselves without a limit or form, and it is
only when they spread themselves upon the earth that they assume a form (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דמיון‎</span>). We can now make the following calculation: the <i>source</i> of the sea’s water and <i>the water stream</i> proceeding therefrom to spread itself <i>are two</i>. A great reservoir is then formed, just as if a huge hollow had been dug; this reservoir
is called sea, and is <i>the third</i>. The unfathomable deep divides itself into <i>seven streams</i>, resembling seven long vessels. The source, the water stream, the sea and the seven
streams make together <i>ten</i>. And when the master breaks the vessels which he has made, the waters return to the
source, and then only remain the pieces of these vessels, dried up and without any
water. It is in this way that the Cause of Causes gave rise to the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>. The Crown is the source from which streams forth an infinite light: hence the name
<i>En Soph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>) = <i>infinite</i>, by which the highest cause is designated: for it then had neither form nor shape,
and there is neither any means whereby to comprehend it, nor a way by which to know
it. Hence it is written, ‘Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither
search the things that are above thy strength.’ ( Ecclus. iii, 21 .) He then made a vessel, as small as a point, like the letter <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span>, which is filled from this source (<i>i.e.</i> <i>the En Soph</i>). This is the source of wisdom, <i>wisdom itself</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>), after which the Supreme Cause is called ‘<i>wise God</i>.’ Upon this he made a large vessel like a sea, which is called <i>Intelligence</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>): hence the name ‘<i>intelligent God</i>.’ It must, however, be remarked that God is wise, and through himself, for <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>wisdom does not derive its name through itself, but through the wise one who fills
it with the light which flows from him, just as intelligence is not comprehended through
itself, but through him who is intelligent and fills it with his own substance. God
needs only to withdraw himself and it would be dried up. This is also the meaning
of the words, ‘the waters have disappeared from the sea, and the bed is dry and parched
up.’ ( Job xiv, 11 .) The sea is finally divided into seven streams, and the seven costly vessels are
produced, which are called <i>Greatness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גדולה‎</span>), <i>Judicial Strength</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גבורה‎</span>), <i>Beauty</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), <i>Firmness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נצח‎</span>), <i>Splendour</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוד‎</span>), <i>Foundation</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>), and <i>Kingdom</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות‎</span>). Therefore is he called the Great or the Merciful, the Mighty, the Glorious, the
God of victory, the Creator, to whom all praise is due, and the Foundation of all
things. Upon the last attribute all the others are based as well as the world. Finally,
he is also the King of the universe, for everything is in his power; he can diminish
the number of the vessels, and increase in them the light which streams from them,
or reduce it, just as it pleases him.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 42 <i>b</i>, 43 <i>a</i>, section <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בא‎</span>.)
</p>
<p>In another place again the same authority gives the following description of the Deity
and the emanation of the <i>Sephiroth</i>. “The Aged of the Aged, the Unknown of the Unknown, has a form and yet has no form.
He has a form whereby the universe is preserved, and yet has no form, because he cannot
be comprehended. When he first assumed the form [of the first <i>Sephira</i>], he caused nine splendid lights to emanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused
a bright light in all directions. Imagine an elevated light sending forth its rays
in all directions. Now if we approach it to examine the rays, we understand no more
than that they emanate from the said light. So is the Holy Aged an absolute light,
but in himself concealed and incomprehensible. We can only comprehend him through
those luminous emanations (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספירות‎</span>) which <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>again are partly visible and partly concealed. These constitute the sacred name of
God.” (<i>Idra Suta</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 288 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>Four things must be borne in mind with regard to the <i>Sephiroth</i>. I. That they were not created by, but emanated (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נאצל‎</span>) from, the <i>En Soph</i>; the difference between creation and emanation being, that in the former a diminution
of strength takes place, whilst in the latter this is not the case.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1814src" href="#xd31e1814">7</a> II. That they form among themselves, and with <i>the En Soph</i>, a strict unity, and simply represent different aspects of one and the same being,
just as the different rays which proceed from the light, and which appear different
things to the eye, form only different manifestations of one and the same light. III.
That since they simply differ from each other as the different colours of the same
light, all the ten emanations alike partake of the perfections of <i>the En Soph</i>; and IV, that, as emanations from the Infinite, the <i>Sephiroth</i> are infinite and perfect like <i>the En Soph</i>, and yet constitute the first finite things.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1844src" href="#xd31e1844">8</a> They are infinite and perfect when <i>the En Soph</i> imparts his fulness to them, and finite and imperfect when the fulness is withdrawn
from them, so that in this respect these ten <i>Sephiroth</i> exactly correspond to the double nature of Christ,—his finite and imperfect human
nature and his infinite and perfect divine nature.
</p>
<p>In their totality and unity these <i>ten Sephiroth</i> are not only denominated <i>the world of Sephiroth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ הספירות‎</span>) and <i>the world of Emanations</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ אצילות‎</span>), but represent and are called the <i>Primordial or Archetypal Man</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדﬦ קדמון‎</span> = <span class="trans" title="prōtogonos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πρωτόγονος</span></span>), and <i>the Heavenly Man</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדם עילאה‎</span>). In the figure, the Crown (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>) is <i>the head</i>; Wisdom (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>), <i>the brains</i>; and Intelligence (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>), which unites the two and <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>produces the first triad, is <i>the heart</i> or <i>the understanding</i>—thus forming <i>the head</i>. The fourth and fifth <i>Sephiroth</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Mercy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד‎</span>) and Justice (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פחד‎</span>), are the two arms of the Lord, the former the right arm and the latter the left,
one distributing life and the other death. And the sixth <i>Sephira</i>, Beauty (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), which unites these two opposites and produces the second triad, is <i>the chest</i>; whilst the seventh and eighth <i>Sephiroth</i>,—<i>i.e.</i>, Firmness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נצח‎</span>) and Splendour (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוד‎</span>), of the third triad,—are <i>the two legs</i>; and Foundation (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>), the ninth <i>Sephira</i>, represents <i>the genital organs</i>, since it denotes the basis and source of all things. Thus it is said “Every thing
will return to its origin just as it proceeded from it. All marrow, all sap, and all
power are congregated in this spot. Hence all powers which exist originate through
the genital organs.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 296 <i>a</i>.) Kingdom (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות‎</span>), the tenth <i>Sephira</i>, represents the harmony of the whole Archetypal Man. The following is the archetypal
figure of the ten <i>Sephiroth</i>.
</p>
<p>It is this form which the prophet Ezekiel saw in the mysterious chariot, and of which
the earthly man is a faint copy. Moreover, these <i>Sephiroth</i>, as we have already remarked, created the world and all things therein according
to their own archetype or in the likeness and similitude of the <i>Heavenly Man</i> or <i>the World of Emanations</i>. But, before we propound the Kabbalistic doctrine of the creation of the world, it
is necessary to describe a second mode in which the trinity of triads in the <i>Sephiroth</i> is represented, and to mention the appellations and offices of the respective triads.

<p>Now in looking at the <i>Sephiroth</i> which constitute the first triad, it will be seen that they represent <i>the intellect</i>; hence this triad is called <i>the Intellectual World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם מושכל‎</span>). The second triad, again, represents <i>moral qualities</i>; hence it is designated <i>the moral or Sensuous World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ מורגש‎</span>): whilst the third triad represents <i>power and stability</i>, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>hence is designated <i>the Material World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ המוטבע‎</span>).

the Greek). In the arrangement of this trinity of triads, so as to produce what is
called the Kabbalistic tree, denominated <i>the Tree of Life</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עץ חיים‎</span>), or simply <i>the Tree</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אילן‎</span>), the first triad is placed above, the second and third are placed below, in such
a manner that the three masculine <i>Sephiroth</i> are on the right, the three feminine on the left, whilst the four uniting <i>Sephiroth</i> occupy the centre, as shown in the following diagrams:—

<p>The three <i>Sephiroth</i> on the right, representing the principle of mercy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e2437" title="Source: הסד">חסד</span>‎</span>), are called <i>the Pillar of Mercy</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סטרא ימינא עמודא דחסד‎</span>); the three on the left, representing the principle of rigour (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דין‎</span>), are denominated <i>the Pillar of Judgment</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סטרא דשמאלא עמודא דדינה‎</span>); whilst the four <i>Sephiroth</i> in the centre, representing mildness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רחמיﬦ‎</span>), <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>are called <i>the Middle Pillar</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עמודא דאמצעיתא‎</span>). Each <i>Sephira</i> composing this trinity of triads is, as it were, a trinity in itself. I, It has its
own absolute character; II, It receives from above; and III, It communicates to what
is below it. Hence the remark, “Just as the Sacred Aged is represented by the number
three, so are all the other lights (<i>Sephiroth</i>) of a threefold nature.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 288 <i>b</i>.) Within this trinity in each unit and trinity of triads there is a trinity of units,
which must be explained before we can propound the Kabbalistic view of the cosmogony.
</p>
<p>We have seen that three of the <i>Sephiroth</i> constitute uniting links between three pairs of opposites, and by this means produce
three triads, respectively denominated the Intellectual World, the Sensuous or Moral
World, and the Material World, and that these three uniting <i>Sephiroth</i>, together with the one which unites the whole into a common unity, form what is called
<i>the Middle Pillar</i> of the Kabbalistic tree. Now from the important position they thus occupy, these
<i>Sephiroth</i> are synecdochically used to represent the worlds which by their uniting potency they
respectively yield. Hence the <i>Sephira</i>, <span class="sc">Crown</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>), from which the <i>Sephiroth</i>, <span class="sc">Wisdom</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>) and <span class="sc">Intelligence</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>), emanated, and by which they are also united, thus yielding <i>the Intellectual World</i>, is by itself used to designate the Intellectual World (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ <span class="corr" id="xd31e2515" title="Source: המוטבע">המושכל</span>‎</span>). Its own names, however, are not changed in this capacity, and it still continues
to be designated by the several appellations mentioned in the description of the first
<i>Sephira</i>. The sixth <i>Sephira</i>, called <span class="sc">Beauty</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), which unites <i>Sephiroth</i> IV (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הסד‎</span>, <i>Love</i>) and V (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פחד‎</span>, <i>Justice</i>), thus yielding <i>the Sensuous World</i>, is by itself used to denote the Sensuous World, and in this capacity is called <i>the Sacred King</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכא קדישא‎</span>), or simply <i>the King</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכא‎</span>); whilst the <i>Sephira</i> called <span class="sc">Kingdom</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות‎</span>), which unites the whole <i>Sephiroth</i>, is here used to represent the Material World, <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>instead of the ninth <i>Sephira</i>, called <span class="sc">Foundation</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>), and is in this capacity denominated <i>the Queen</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכתא‎</span>) or <i>the Matron</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטרוניתא‎</span>). Thus we obtain within the trinity of triads a higher trinity of units,—viz., <i>the Crown</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>), <i>Beauty</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), and <i>Kingdom</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות‎</span>),—which represents the potencies of all the <i>Sephiroth</i>.
</p>
<p>II. <i>The Creation or the Kabbalistic Cosmogony.</i>
</p>
<p>Having arrived at the highest trinity which comprises all the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and which consists of <i>the Crown</i>, <i>the King</i>, and <i>the Queen</i>, we shall be able to enter into the cosmogony of the Kabbalah. Now, it is not the
<i>En Soph</i> who created the world, but this trinity, as represented in the combination of the
<i>Sephiroth</i>; or rather the creation has arisen from the conjunction of the emanations. The world
was born from the union of the crowned King and Queen; or, according to the language
of the Kabbalah, these opposite sexes of royalty, who emanated from the <i>En Soph</i>, produced the universe in their own image. Worlds, we are told, were indeed created
before ever the King and Queen or the <i>Sephiroth</i> gave birth to the present state of things, but they could not continue, and necessarily
perished, because the <i>En Soph</i> had not yet assumed this human form in its completeness, which not only implies a
moral and intellectual nature, but, as conditions of development, procreation, and
continuance, also comprises sexual opposites. This creation, which aborted and which
has been succeeded by the present order of things, is indicated in Gen. xxxvi, 31–40 . The kings of Edom, or the old kings as they are also denominated, who are here said
to have reigned before the monarchs of Israel, and are mentioned as having died one
after the other, are those primordial worlds which were successively convulsed and
destroyed; whilst the sovereigns of Israel denote the King and Queen who emanated
from the <i>En Soph</i>, and who have given birth to and perpetuate the present world. Thus we are told:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Before the Aged of the Aged, the Concealed of the Concealed, expanded into the form
of King, the Crown of Crowns [<i>i.e.</i> the first <i>Sephira</i>], there was neither beginning nor end. He hewed and incised forms and figures into
it [<i>i.e.</i> the crown] in the following manner:—He spread before him a cover, and carved therein
kings [<i>i.e.</i> worlds], and marked out their limits and forms, but they could not preserve themselves.
Therefore it is written, ‘These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before
there reigned any king over the children of Israel.’ ( Gen. xxxvi, 31 .) This refers to the primordial kings and primordial Israel. All these were imperfect:
he therefore removed them and let them vanish, till he finally descended himself to
this cover and assumed a form.” (<i>Idra Rabba</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 148 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>This important fact that worlds were created and destroyed prior to the present creation
is again and again reiterated in <i>the Sohar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2662src" href="#xd31e2662">9</a> These worlds are compared with sparks which fly out from a red hot iron beaten by
a hammer, and which are extinguished according to the distance they are removed from
the burning mass. “There were old worlds,” <i>the Sohar</i> tells us, “which perished as soon as they came into existence: were formless, and
they were called sparks. Thus the smith when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly
in all directions. These sparks are the primordial worlds, which could not continue,
because the Sacred Aged had not as yet assumed his form [of opposite sexes—the King
and Queen], and the master was not yet at his work.” (<i>Idra Suta</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 292 <i>b</i>.) But since nothing can be annihilated—“Nothing perisheth in this world, not even
the breath which issues from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>mouth, for this, like everything else, has its place and destination, and the Holy
One, blessed be his name! turns it into his service;” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 110 <i>b</i>.)—these worlds could not be absolutely destroyed. Hence when the question is asked—‘Why
were these primordial worlds destroyed?’ the reply is given—“Because the Man, represented
by the ten <i>Sephiroth</i>, was not as yet. The human form contains every thing, and as it did not as yet exist,
the worlds were destroyed.” It is added, “Still when it is said that they perished,
it is only meant thereby that they lacked the true form, till the human form came
into being, in which all things are comprised, and which also contains all those forms.
Hence, though the Scripture ascribes death (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וימות‎</span>) to the kings of Edom, it only denotes a sinking down from their dignity, <i>i.e.</i>, the worlds up to that time did not answer to the Divine idea, since they had not
as yet the perfect form of which they were capable.” (<i>Idra Rabba</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 135 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>It was therefore after the destruction of previous worlds, and after the <i>En Soph</i> or the Boundless assumed the Sephiric form, that the present world was created. “The
Holy One, blessed be he, created and destroyed several worlds before the present one
was made, and when this last work was nigh completion, all the things of this world,
all the creatures of the universe, in whatever age they were to exist, before ever
they entered into this world, were present before God in their true form. Thus are
the words of Ecclesiastes to be understood ‘What was, shall be, and what has been
done, shall be done.’ ” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 61 <i>b</i>.) “The lower world is made after the pattern of the upper world; every thing which
exists in the upper world is to be found as it were in a copy upon earth; still the
whole is one.” (<i>Ibid<span class="corr" id="xd31e2714" title="Not in source">.,</span></i> ii, 20 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>This world, however, is not a creation <i lang="la">ex nihilo</i>, but is simply an immanent offspring and the image of the King and Queen, or, in
other words, a farther expansion or evolution of <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span><i>the Sephiroth</i> which are the emanations of <i>the En Soph</i>. This is expressed in <i>the Sohar</i> in the following passage—“The indivisible point [the Absolute], who has no limit,
and who cannot be comprehended because of his purity and brightness, expanded from
without, and formed a brightness which served as a covering to the indivisible point,
yet it too could not be viewed in consequence of its immeasurable light. It too expanded
from without, and this expansion was its garment. Thus everything originated through
a constant upheaving agitation, and thus finally the world originated.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 20 <i>a</i>.) The universe therefore is an immanent emanation from <i>the Sephiroth</i>, and reveals and makes visible the Boundless and the Concealed of the Concealed.
And though it exhibits the Deity in less splendour than its parents the <i>Sephiroth</i>, because it is further removed from the primordial source of light, yet, as it is
God manifested, all the multifarious forms in the world point out the unity which
they represent; and nothing in it can be destroyed, but everything must return to
the source whence it emanated. Hence it is said that “all things of which this world
consists, spirit as well as body, will return to their principal, and the root from
which they proceeded.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 218 <i>b</i>.) “He is the beginning and end of all the degrees in the creation. All these degrees
are stamped with his seal, and he cannot be otherwise described than by the unity.
He is one, notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him.” (<i>Ibid<span class="corr" id="xd31e2745" title="Not in source">.,</span></i> i, 21 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>Now these <i>Sephiroth</i>, or the <i>World of Emanation</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם אצילות‎</span>), or the <i>Atzilatic World</i>, gave birth to <i>three</i> worlds in the following order:—From the conjunction of the <span class="sc">King</span> and <span class="sc">Queen</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>) proceeded—I. <i>The World of Creation</i>, or <i>the Briatic World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הבריאה‎</span>), also called <i>The Throne</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כורסיא‎</span>), which is the abode of pure spirits, and which, like its parents, consists of ten
<i>Sephiroth</i>, or Emanations. The <i>Briatic World</i>, again, gave rise to, <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>II. <i>The World of Formation</i>, or the <i>Jetziratic World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ היצירה‎</span>), which is the habitation of the angels, and also consists of ten <i>Sephiroth</i>; whilst the <i>Jetziratic World</i>, again, sent forth, III. <i>The World of Action</i>, or <i>the Assiatic World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ העשיה‎</span>), also called <i>the World of Keliphoth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולﬦ הקליפות‎</span>), which contains <i>the Spheres</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גלגלים‎</span>) and matter, and is the residence of the Prince of Darkness and his legions. Or,
as the <i>Sohar</i> describes it—“After the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and for their use, God made <i>the Throne</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the World of Creation), with four legs and six steps, thus making ten (<i>i.e.</i>, the decade of <i>Sephiroth</i> which each world has).… For this Throne and its service he formed the ten Angelic
hosts (<i>i.e.</i>, the World of Formation), <i>Malachim</i>, <i>Arelim</i>, <i>Chajoth</i>, <i>Ophanim</i>, <i>Chashmalim</i>, <i>Elim</i>, <i>Elohim</i>, <i>Benei Elohim</i>, <i>Ishim</i>, and <i>Seraphim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכיﬦ אראליﬦ חיות אופניﬦ חשמליﬦ אליﬦ אלהיﬦ בני אלהים אישים שרפים‎</span>), and for their service, again, he made Samaël and his legions (<i>i.e.</i>, the World of Action), who are, as it were, the clouds upon which the angels ride
in their descent on the earth, and serve, as it were, for their horses. Hence it is
written—‘Behold the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt.’ ”
( Isa. xix, 1 .) (<i>Sohar</i> ii, 43 <i>a</i>.) There are, therefore, <i>four</i> worlds, each of which has a separate Sephiric system, consisting of a decade of emanations.
I. The <i>Atzilatic World</i>, called alternately <i>the World of Emanations</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם אצילות‎</span>), <i>the Image</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דיוקנא‎</span> = <span class="trans" title="eikōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e2891" title="Source: εικών">εἰκών</span></span></span> with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ד‎</span> prefixed), and <i>the Heavenly Man</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדם עלאה‎</span>), which, by virtue of its being a direct emanation from God and most intimately allied
with the Deity, is perfect and immutable. II. <i>The Briatic World</i>, called <i>the World of Creation</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הבריאה‎</span>) and <i>the Throne</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כורסיא‎</span>), which is the immediate emanation of the former, and whose <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, being further removed from the <i>En Soph</i>, are of a more limited and circumscribed potency, though the substances they comprise
are of the purest nature and without <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>any admixture of matter. III. <i>The Jetziratic World</i>, called <i>the World of Formation</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם היצירה‎</span>) and <i>the World of Angels</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלאכיא‎</span>), which proceeded from the former world, and whose <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, though of a still less refined substance than the former, because further removed
from the primordial source, are still without matter. It is in this angelic world
where those intelligent and uncorporeal beings reside, who are wrapped in a luminous
garment, and who assume a sensuous form when they appear to man. And IV. <i>The Assiatic World</i>, called <i>the World of Action</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם העשיה‎</span>) and <i>the World of Matter</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הקליפות‎</span>) which emanated from the preceding world, the <i>ten Sephiroth</i> of which are made up of the grosser elements of all the former three worlds, and
which has sunk down in consequence of its materiality and heaviness. Its substances
consist of matter limited by space and perceptible to the senses in a multiplicity
of forms. It is subject to constant changes, generations, and corruptions, and is
the abode of the Evil Spirit.
</p>
<p>Before leaving this doctrine about the creation and the relationship of the Supreme
Being to the universe, we must reiterate two things. I. Though the trinity of <i>the Sephiroth</i> gave birth to the universe, or, in other words, is an evolution of the emanations,
and is thus a further expansion of the Deity itself, it must not be supposed that
the Kabbalists believe in a Trinity in our sense of the word. Their view on this subject
will best be understood from the following remark in <i>the Sohar</i>—“Whoso wishes to have an insight into the sacred unity, let him consider a flame
rising from a burning coal or a burning lamp. He will see first a twofold light, a
bright white and a black or blue light; the white light is <i>above</i>, and ascends in a direct light, whilst the blue or dark light is <i>below</i>, and seems as the chair of the former, yet both are so intimately connected together
that they constitute only one flame. The seat, however, formed by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>blue or dark light, is again connected with the burning matter which is <i>under it</i> again. The white light never changes its colour, it always remains white; but various
shades are observed in the lower light, whilst the lowest light, moreover, takes two
directions—<i>above</i> it is connected with the white light, and <i>below</i> with the burning matter. Now this is constantly consuming itself, and perpetually
ascends to the upper light, and thus everything merges into a single unity (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וכולא אתקשר ביחודא חד‎</span> <i>Sohar</i>, i, 51 <i>a</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2985src" href="#xd31e2985">10</a> And II. The creation, or the universe, is simply the garment of God woven from the
Deity’s own substance; or, as Spinoza expresses it, God is the immanent basis of the
universe. For although, to reveal himself to us, the Concealed of all the Concealed
sent forth the ten emanations called the <i>Form of God</i>, <i>Form of the Heavenly Man</i>, yet since even this luminous form was too dazzling for our vision, it had to assume
another form, or had to put on another garment which consists of the universe. The
universe, therefore, or the visible world, is a further expansion of the Divine Substance,
and is called in the Kabbalah “<i>the Garment of God</i>.” Thus we are told, “when the Concealed of all the Concealed wanted to reveal himself,
he first made a point [<i>i.e.</i> the first <i>Sephira</i>], shaped it into a sacred form [<i>i.e.</i> the totality of <i>the Sephiroth</i>], and covered it with a rich and splendid garment that is the world.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 2 <i>a</i>).
</p>
<p>III. <i>The Creation of Angels and Men.</i>
</p>
<p>The different worlds which successively emanated from the <i>En Soph</i> and from each other, and which sustain the relationship to the Deity of first, second,
third, and fourth generations, are, with the exception of the first (<i>i.e.</i>, the World of Emanations), inhabited by spiritual beings of various grades. <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>“God animated every part of the firmament with a separate spirit, and forthwith all
the heavenly hosts were before him. This is meant by the Psalmist, when he says ( Ps. xxxiii, 6 ) ‘By the breath of his mouth were made all their hosts.’ (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 68 <i>a</i>.) These angels consist of two kinds—good and bad; they have their respective princes,
and occupy the three habitable worlds in the following order. As has already been
remarked, the first world, or the Archetypal Man, in whose image everything is formed,
is occupied by no one else. The angel <span class="sc">Metatron</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטטרון‎</span>) occupies the second or <i>the Briatic World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ עולם בריאה‎</span>), which is the first habitable world; he alone constitutes the world of pure spirits.
He is the garment of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שדי‎</span> <i>i.e.</i>, the visible manifestation of the Deity; his name is numerically equivalent to that
of the Lord. (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 231 <i>a</i>.) He governs the visible world, preserves the unity, harmony, and the revolutions
of all the spheres, planets and heavenly bodies, and is the Captain of the myriads
of the angelic hosts<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3051src" href="#xd31e3051">11</a> who people the second habitable or <i>the Jetziratic <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם <span class="corr" id="xd31e3224" title="Source: יצירה">היצירה</span>‎</span>), and who are divided into ten ranks, answering to the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>. Each of these angels is set over a different part of the universe. One has the control
of one sphere, another of another heavenly body; one angel has charge of the sun,
another of the moon, another of the earth, another of the sea, another of the fire,
another of the wind, another of the light, another of the seasons, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and these
angels derive their names from the heavenly bodies they respectively guard. Hence
one is called Venus (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נגה‎</span>), one Mars (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מאדמים‎</span>), one the substance of Heaven (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עצם השמים‎</span>), one the angel of light (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוריאל‎</span>), and another the angel of fire (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוריאל‎</span>.) (Comp. <i>Sohar</i> i, 42, &amp;c.) The demons, constituting the second class of angels, which are the grossest
and most deficient of all forms, and are <i>the shells</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קליפות‎</span>) of being, inhabit the third habitable or <i>Assiatic World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם עשיה‎</span>). They, too, form ten degrees, answering to the decade of <i>Sephiroth</i>, in which darkness and impurity increase with the descent of each degree. Thus the
two first degrees are nothing more than the absence of all visible form and organisation,
which the Mosaic cosmology describes in the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהו ובהו‎</span> before the hexahemeron, and which the Septuagint renders by <span class="trans" title="aoratos kai akataskeuastos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀόρατος καὶ <span class="corr" id="xd31e3270" title="Source: ακατασκεύαστος">ἀκατασκεύαστος</span></span></span>. The third degree is the abode of the darkness which the book of Genesis describes
as having in the beginning covered the face of the earth. Whereupon follow seven infernal
halls (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע היכלות‎</span>) = <span class="sc">Hells</span>, occupied by the demons, which are the incarnation of all human vices, and which
torture those poor deluded beings who suffered themselves to be led astray in this
world. These seven infernal halls are subdivided into endless compartments, so as
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>afford a separate chamber of torture for every species of sin. The prince of this
region of darkness, who is called Satan in the Bible, is denominated by the Kabbalah,
<i>Samaël</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סמאל‎</span>) = <i>angel of poison</i> or <i>of death</i>. He is the same evil spirit, Satan, the serpent, who seduced Eve.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3298src" href="#xd31e3298">12</a> He has a wife, called the Harlot or the Woman of Whoredom (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשת זנוניﬦ‎</span>), but they are both generally represented as united in the one name of <i>the Beast</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיוא‎</span>. Comp. <i>Sohar</i>, ii, 255–259, with i, 35 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>The whole universe, however, was incomplete, and did not receive its finishing stroke
till man was formed, who is the acme of the creation, and the microcosm uniting in
himself the totality of beings. “The <span class="sc">Heavenly Adam</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, the ten <i>Sephiroth</i>), who emanated from the highest primordial obscurity (<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>En Soph</i>), created the <span class="sc">Earthly Adam</span>.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 70 <i>b</i>.) “Man is both the import and the highest degree of creation, for which reason he
was formed on the sixth day. As soon as man was created, everything was complete,
including the upper and nether worlds, for everything is comprised in man. He unites
in himself all forms.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 48 <i>a</i>.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3348src" href="#xd31e3348">13</a> Man was created with faculties and features far transcending those of the angels.
The bodies of the protoplasts were not of that gross matter which constitutes our
bodies. Adam and Eve, before the fall, were wrapped in that luminous ethereal substance
in which the celestial spirits are clad, and which is neither subject to want nor
to sensual desires. They were envied by the angels of the highest rank. The fall,
however, changed it all, as we are told in the following passage—“When Adam <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>dwelled in the garden of Eden, he was dressed in the celestial garment, which is a
garment of heavenly light. But when he was expelled from the garden of Eden, and became
subject to the wants of this world, what is written? ‘The Lord God made coats of skins
unto Adam and to his wife, and clothed them’ ( Gen. iii, 21 ); for prior to this they had garments of light—light of that light which was used
in the garden of Eden.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 229 <i>b</i>.) The garments of skin, therefore, mean our present body, which was given to our
first parents in order to adapt them to the changes which the fall introduced.
</p>
<p>But even in the present form, the righteous are above the angels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3374src" href="#xd31e3374">14</a> and every man is still the microcosm, and every member of his body corresponds to
a constituent part of the visible universe. “What is man? Is he simply skin, flesh,
bones, and veins? No! That which constitutes the real man is the soul, and those things
which are called the skin, the flesh, the bones, and the veins, all these are merely
a garment, they are simply the clothes of the man, but not the man himself. When man
departs, he puts off these garments wherewith the son of man is clothed. Yet are all
these bones and sinews formed in the secret of the highest wisdom, after the heavenly
image. The skin represents the firmament, which extends everywhere, and covers everything
like a garment—as it is written, ‘Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain.’
( Ps. clv, 2 ) … The flesh represents the deteriorated part of the world;… the bones and the veins
represent the heavenly chariot, the inner powers, the servants of God.… But these
are the <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>outer garments, for in the inward part is the deep mystery of the heavenly man. Everything
here below, as above, is mysterious. Therefore it is written—‘God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him’ ( Gen. i, 27 ); repeating the word God twice, one for the man and the other for the woman. The
mystery of the earthly man is after the mystery of the Heavenly Man. And just as we
see in the firmament above, covering all things, different signs which are formed
of the stars and planets, and which contain secret things and profound mysteries,
studied by those who are wise and expert in these signs; so there are in the skin,
which is the cover of the body of the son of man, and which is like the sky that covers
all things, signs and features which are the stars and planets of the skin, indicating
secret things and profound mysteries, whereby the wise are attracted, who understand
to read the mysteries in the human face.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 76 <i>a</i>.) He is still the presence of God upon earth (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שכינתא תתאה‎</span>), and the very form of the body depicts the Tetragrammaton, the most sacred name
Jehovah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>). Thus the head is the form of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span>, the arms and the shoulders are like the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span>, the breast represents the form of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span>, whilst the two legs with the back represent the form of the second <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span>. (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 42 <i>a</i>.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3429src" href="#xd31e3429">15</a>
</p>
<p>The souls of all these epitomes of the universe are pre-existent in the World of Emanations,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3449src" href="#xd31e3449">16</a> and are without exception <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>destined to inhabit human bodies, and pursue their course upon earth for a certain
number of years. Hence we are told that, “When the Holy One, blessed be his name,
wished to create the world, the universe was before him in idea. He then formed all
the souls which are destined for the whole human race. All were minutely before him
in the same form which they were to assume in the human body. He looked at each one
of them; and there were some among them which would corrupt their way upon the earth.”
(<i>Sohar</i>, i, 96 <i>b</i>). Like the <i>Sephiroth</i> from which it emanates, every soul has ten potencies, which are subdivided into a
trinity of triads, and are respectively represented by (I) <i>The Spirit</i>, (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשמה‎</span>), which is the highest degree of being, and which both corresponds to and is operated
upon by <span class="sc">The Crown</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר‎</span>), representing the highest triad in the <i>Sephiroth</i>, called the Intellectual World; (II) <i>The Soul</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח‎</span>), which is the seat of good and evil, as well as the moral qualities, and which both
corresponds to and is operated upon by <span class="sc">Beauty</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>), representing the second triad in the <i>Sephiroth</i>, called the Moral World; and (III) <i>The Cruder Spirit</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נפש‎</span>), which is immediately connected with the body, is the direct cause of its lower
functions, instincts, and animal life, and which both corresponds to and is operated
upon by <span class="sc">Foundation</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יסוד‎</span>), representing the third triad in the <i>Sephiroth</i>, called the Material World.
</p>
<p>In its original state each soul is androgynous, and is separated into male and female
when it descends on earth to be borne in a human body. We have seen that the souls
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>the righteous, in the world of spirits, are superior in dignity to the heavenly powers
and the ministering angels. It might, therefore, be asked why do these souls leave
such an abode of bliss, and come into this vale of tears to dwell in tabernacles of
clay? The only reply to be given is that these happy souls have no choice in the matter.
Indeed we are told that the soul, before assuming a human body, addresses God—<span class="corr" id="xd31e3574" title="Source: ‘">“</span>Lord of the Universe! I am happy in this world, and do not wish to go into another
world, where I shall be a bond-maid, and be exposed to all kinds of pollutions.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 96.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3579src" href="#xd31e3579">17</a> And can you wonder at this pitiful ejaculation? Should your philanthropic feelings
and your convictions that our heavenly Father ordains all things for the good of his
children, impel you to ask that an explanation of this mystery might graciously be
vouchsafed to you in order to temper your compassion and calm your faith, then take
this parable. “A son was born to a King; he sends him to the country, there to be
nursed and brought up till he is grown up, and instructed in the ceremonies and usages
of the royal palace. When the King hears that the education of his son is finished,
what does his fatherly love impel him to do? For his son’s sake he sends for the Queen
his mother, conducts him into the palace and makes merry with him all day. Thus the
Holy One, blessed be he, has a son with the Queen: this is the heavenly and sacred
soul. He sends him into the country, that is into this world, therein to grow up and
to learn the customs of the court. When the King hears that this his son has grown
up in the country, and that it is time to bring him into the palace, what does his
love for his son impel him to do? He sends, for his sake, <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>for the Queen and conducts him to the palace.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 245 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>As has already been remarked, the human soul, before it descends into the world, is
androgynous, or in other words, consists of two component parts, each of which comprises
all the elements of our spiritual nature. Thus the <i>Sohar</i> tells us—“Each soul and spirit, prior to its entering into this world, consists of
a male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts
separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the Holy One,
blessed be he, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before,
and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and
left of one individual; therefore ‘There is nothing new under the sun.’ (<span class="corr" id="xd31e3599" title="Source: Ecl.">Eccl.</span> i, 9 .)… This union, however, is influenced by the deeds of the man and by the ways in
which he walks. If the man is pure and his conduct is pleasing in the sight of God,
he is united with that female part of his soul which was his component part prior
to his birth.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 91 <i>b</i>.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3607src" href="#xd31e3607">18</a> The soul carries her knowledge with her to the earth, so that “every thing which
she learns here below she knew already, before she entered into this world.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, iii, 61 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>Since the form of the body as well as the soul, is made after the image of the Heavenly
Man, a figure of the forthcoming body which is to clothe the newly descending soul,
is sent down from the celestial regions, to hover over the couch of the husband and
wife when they copulate, in order that the conception may be formed according to this
model. “At <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>connubial intercourse on earth, the Holy One, blessed be he, sends a human form which
bears the impress of the divine stamp. This form is present at intercourse, and if
we were permitted to see it we should perceive over our heads an image resembling
a human face; and it is in this image that we are formed. As long as this image is
not sent by God and does not descend and hover over our heads, there can be no conception,
for it is written—‘And God created man in his own image.’ ( Gen. i, 27 .) This image receives us when we enter the world, it <span class="corr" id="xd31e3623" title="Source: developes">develops</span> itself with us when we grow, and accompanies us when we depart this life; as it is
written—‘Surely, man walked in an image’ ( Ps. xxxvii, 5 ): and this image is from heaven. When the souls are to leave their heavenly abode,
each soul separately appears before the Holy King, dressed in a sublime form, with
the features in which it is to appear in this world. It is from this sublime form
that the image proceeds. It is the third after the soul, and precedes it on the earth;
it is present at the conception, and there is no conception in the world where this
image is not present.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 104 <i>a</i> <i>b</i>.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3636src" href="#xd31e3636">19</a>
</p>
<p>All human countenances are divisible into the four primordial types of faces, which
appeared at the mysterious chariot throne in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel, viz.,
the face of man, of the lion, the ox and the eagle. Our faces resemble these more
or less according to the rank which our souls occupy in the intellectual or moral
dominion. “And physiognomy does not consist in the external lineaments, but in the
features which are mysteriously drawn in us. The features <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>in the face change according to the form which is peculiar to the inward face of the
spirit. It is the spirit which produces all those physiognomical peculiarities known
to the wise; and it is only through the spirit that the features have any meaning.
All those spirits and souls which proceed from Eden (<i>i.e.</i>, the highest wisdom) have a peculiar form, which is reflected in the face.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 73 <i>b</i>.) The face thus lighted up by the peculiar spirit inhabiting the body, is the mirror
of the soul; and the formation of the head indicates the character and temper of the
man. An arched forehead is a sign of a cheerful and profound spirit, as well as of
a distinguished intellect; a broad but flat forehead indicates foolishness and silliness;
whilst a forehead which is flat, compressed on the sides and spiral, betokens narrowness
of mind and vanity. (Comp. <i>Sohar</i>, ii, 71 <i>b</i>, 75 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>As a necessary condition of free existence and of moral being, the souls are endowed
by the Deity, from the very beginning, with the power of adhering in close proximity
to the primordial source of infinite light from which they emanated, and of alienating
themselves from that source and pursuing an independent and opposite course. Hence,
Simon ben Jochai said, “If the Holy One, blessed be he, had not put within us both
the good and the evil desire, which are denominated light and darkness, the created
man would have neither virtue nor vice. For this reason it is written—‘Behold, I have
set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.’ ( Deut. xxx, 15 .) To this the disciples replied, Wherefore is all this? Would it not be better if
reward and punishment had not existed at all, since in that case man would have been
incapable of sinning and of doing evil. He rejoined, It was meet and right that he
should be created as he was created, because the Law was created for him, wherein
are written punishments for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>wicked and rewards for the righteous; and there would not have been any reward for
the righteous and punishment for the wicked but for created man.” (<i>Sohar</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e3702" title="Not in source">,</span> i, 23 <i>a</i>.) So complete is their independence, that souls, even in their pre-existent state,
can and do choose which way they intend to pursue. “All souls which are not guiltless
in this world, have already alienated themselves in heaven from the Holy One, blessed
be he; they have thrown themselves into an abyss at their very existence, and have
anticipated the time when they are to descend on earth.… Thus were the souls before
they came into this world.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, iii, 61 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>IV. <i>The Destiny of Man and the Universe.</i>
</p>
<p>As <i>the En Soph</i> constituted man the microcosm, and as the Deity is reflected in this epitome of the
universe more than in any component part of the creation, all things visible and invisible
are designed to aid him in passing through his probationary state here below, in gathering
that experience for which his soul has been sent down, and in returning in a pure
state to that source of light from which his soul emanated. This destiny of man—<i>i.e.</i>, the reunion with the Deity from which he emanated—is the constant desire both of
God and man, and is an essential principle of the soul, underlying its very essence.
Discarding that blind power from our nature, which governs our animal life, which
never quits this earth, and which therefore plays no part in our spiritual being,
the soul possesses two kinds of powers and two sorts of feelings. It has the faculty
for that extraordinary prophetical knowledge, which was vouchsafed to Moses in an
exceptional manner, called <i>the Luminous Mirror</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אספקלריא נהרא‎</span> = <i lang="la">specularia</i>), and the ordinary knowledge termed <i>the Non-Luminous Mirror</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אספקלריא דלא נהרא‎</span>), respectively represented in the earthly Paradise by the Tree of Life and the Tree
of Knowledge of good and evil; and it possesses <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>the higher feeling of love and the lower feeling of fear.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3737src" href="#xd31e3737">20</a> Now the full fruition of that higher knowledge and of that loftier feeling of love
can only be reaped when the soul returns to the Infinite Source of Light, and is wrapped
in that luminous garment which the protoplasts forfeited through the fall. Thus we
are told, “Come and see when the soul reaches that place which is called the Treasury
of Life (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צרורא דחיי‎</span>), she enjoys a bright and luminous mirror (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אספקלריאה דנהרא‎</span>), which receives its light from the highest heaven. The soul could not bear this
light but for the luminous mantle which she puts on. For just as the soul, when sent
to this earth, puts on an earthly garment to preserve herself here, so she receives
above a shining garment, in order to be able to look without injury into the mirror
whose light proceeds from the Lord of Light. Moses too could not approach to look
into that higher light which he saw, without putting on such an ethereal garment;
as it is written—‘And Moses went into the midst of the cloud’ ( Exod. xxiv, 18 ), which is to be translated <i>by means</i> of the cloud wherewith he wrapped himself as if dressed in a garment. At that time
Moses almost discarded the whole of his earthly nature; as it is written,—‘And Moses
was on the mountain forty days and forty nights’ (<i>ibid.</i>); and he thus approached that dark cloud where God is enthroned. In this wise the
departed spirits of the righteous dress themselves in the upper regions in luminous
garments, to be able to endure that light which streams from the Lord of Light.” (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 65 <i>b</i>, 66 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>The two feelings of love and fear are designed to aid the soul in achieving her high
destiny, when she shall no more <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>look through the dark glass, but see face to face in the presence of the Luminous
Mirror, by permeating all acts of obedience and divine worship. And though perfect
love, which is serving God purely out of love, like that higher knowledge, is to be
man’s destiny in heaven, yet the soul may attain some of it on earth, and endeavour
to serve God out of love and not from fear, as thereby she will have an antepast on
earth of its union with the Deity, which is to be so rapturous and indissoluble in
heaven. “Yet is the service which arises from fear not to be depreciated, for fear
leads to love. It is true that he who obeys God out of love has attained to the highest
degree, and already belongs to the saints of the world to come, but it must not be
supposed that to worship God out of fear is no worship. Such a service has also its
merit, though in this case the union of the soul with the Deity is slight. There is
only one degree which is higher than fear: it is love. In love is the mystery of the
divine unity. It is love which unites the higher and lower degrees together; it elevates
everything to that position where everything must be one. This is also the mystery
of the words, ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one God.’ ” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 216 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>Hence it is that these two principles play so important a part in the devotions and
contemplations of the Kabbalists; Love is made to correspond to <span class="sc">Mercy</span>, the fourth <i>Sephira</i>, whilst Fear is made to answer to <span class="sc">Rigour</span>, the fifth <i>Sephira</i>; and it is asserted that when these two principles are thoroughly combined by the
righteous in their divine worship and acts of obedience, the name Jehovah, which comprises
these two principles, and which is now rent in twain by the preponderance of sin and
disobedience, will be re-united. Then, and then only, will all the souls return to
the bosom of the Father of our spirits; then will the restitution of all things take
place, and the earth shall be covered with the knowledge of God even as the waters
cover the sea. This is the reason why the <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>Kabbalists utter the following prayer prior to the performance of any of the commandments:
“For the re-union of the Holy One, blessed be his name, and his Shechinah, I do this
in love and fear, in fear and love, for the union of the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יה‎</span> with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וה‎</span> into a perfect harmony! I pronounce this in the name of all Israel!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3810src" href="#xd31e3810">21</a> In order to represent this union to the senses the words <i>Fear</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יראה‎</span> and <i>Love</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבה‎</span>, are divided, and so placed above each other that they may be read either across
or down, as follows:—

<p>When thus fulfilling the commandments the pious not only enjoy a prelibation of that
sublime light which shines in heaven, and which will serve them as a garment when
they enter into the other world and appear before the Holy One (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 299 <i>b</i>), but become on earth already the habitation of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and each saint has that <i>Sephira</i> incarnate in him which corresponds to the virtue he most cultivates, or to the feature
most predominant in his character. Among the patriarchs, therefore, who were the most
exalted in piety, we find that <span class="sc">Love</span>, the fourth <i>Sephira</i>, was incarnate in Abraham; <span class="sc">Rigour</span>, the fifth <i>Sephira</i>, in Isaac; <span class="sc">Mildness</span>, the sixth <i>Sephira</i>, in Jacob; <span class="sc">Firmness</span>, the seventh <i>Sephira</i>, in Moses; <span class="sc">Splendour</span>, the eighth <i>Sephira</i>, in Aaron; <span class="sc">Foundation</span>, the ninth <i>Sephira</i>, in Joseph; and <span class="sc">Kingdom</span>, the tenth <i>Sephira</i>, was incarnate in David. Hence all the righteous who constitute the emanations, of
the <i>ten Sephiroth</i> are divided into three classes corresponding to the three principles or Pillars exhibited
in the Kabbalistic Tree, viz.:—I. <span class="sc">The Pillar of Mercy</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד‎</span>), represented by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>Patriarch Abraham (comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד לאברהם‎</span> Micah, vii, 20 ;) II. <span class="sc">The Pillar of Justice</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פחד‎</span>), represented by Isaac (comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פחד יצחק‎</span> Gen. xxxi, 42 ); and III. <span class="sc">The Middle Pillar</span>, represented by Jacob (comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמת ליעקב‎</span> Micah vii, 20 ), which is the connecting or uniting principle. (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 146 <i>a</i>; 148 <i>b</i>.) It is for this reason that the patriarchs are denominated the Chariot-throne of
the Lord.
</p>
<p>Following the paths of righteousness, the saints on earth enjoy the protection of
heaven in an especial manner, by virtue of the divine wisdom inherent in them, for
they are able to decipher the signs which God has put in the firmament to shield them
from accidents. “In heaven above, that surrounds the universe, are signs in which
the deepest mysteries are concealed. These signs are constellations and stars, which
are studied and deciphered by the wise.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 76 <i>a</i>.) Hence the admonition—“He who has to start on a journey very early, should rise
at daybreak, look carefully towards the east, and he will perceive certain signs resembling
letters which pierce through the sky and appear above the horizon. These shining forms
are those of the letters wherewith God created heaven and earth. Now, if man knows
the secret meaning of the sacred name, consisting of forty-two letters, and meditates
on it with becoming devotion and enthusiasm, he will perceive six <i>Jods</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוד״ין‎</span>) in the pure sky, three to the right and three to the left, as well as three <i>Vavs</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וו״ין‎</span>), which hover about in the heavenly arch. These are the letters of the priestly benediction
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברכת כהנים‎</span>).… In the bright morning he will perceive a pillar towards the west, hanging perpendicularly
over the earthly paradise, and another pillar hanging over the centre of paradise.
This luminous pillar has the three colours of a purple web: three birds stand on it,
singing in the following manner. The first sings, ‘Hallelujah! Praise, O ye servants
of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord’ ( Ps. cxiii, 1 ); the second, ‘Blessed be the name <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore’ (<i>ibid.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e3964" title="Not in source">,</span> v. 2 ); and the third, ‘From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the
Lord’s name is to be praised’ (<i>ibid.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e3971" title="Not in source">,</span> v. 3 ). This is the time when the pious traveller is to offer up his morning prayer, in
order that he may secure heaven’s blessings and the sublime and divine mercy as his
sure guide.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 130 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>Now since it is an absolute condition of the soul to return to the Infinite Source
from which it emanated, after developing all those perfections, the germs of which
are eternally implanted in it; and since some souls do not at once develope these
fruits of righteousness, which precludes their immediate reunion with their Primordial
Source, another term of life is vouchsafed to them, so that they may be able to cultivate
those virtues which they stifled in their former bodily life, and without which it
is impossible for them to return to their heavenly home. Hence, if the soul, in its
first assuming a human body and sojourn on earth, fails to acquire that experience
for which it descends from heaven, and becomes contaminated by that which is polluting,
it must re-inhabit a body again and again till it is able to ascend in a purified
state through repeated trials. Thus we are told that<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3982src" href="#xd31e3982">22</a> “All souls are subject to transmigration (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עאין בגלגולא‎</span>), and men do not know the ways of the Holy One, blessed be he; they do not know that
they are brought before the tribunal, both before they enter into this world and after
they quit it, they are ignorant of the many transmigrations and secret probations
which they have to undergo, and of the number of souls and spirits which enter into
this world, and do not return to the palace of the Heavenly King. Men do not know
how the <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>souls revolve like a stone which is thrown from a sling; as it is written—‘And the
souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.’
( 1 Sam., xxv, 29 .) But the time is at hand when these mysteries will be disclosed.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 99 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>The transmigration of the soul into another body, however, is restricted to three
times; and if two souls in their third residence in human bodies are still too weak
to resist all earthly trammels and to acquire the necessary experience, they are both
united and sent into one body, so that they may be able conjointly to learn that which
they were too feeble to do separately. It sometimes, however, happens that it is the
singleness and isolation of the soul which is the source of her weakness, and she
requires help to pass through her probation. In that case she chooses for a companion
a soul which has more strength and better fortune. The stronger of the two then becomes
as it were the mother; she carries the sickly one in her bosom, and nurses her from
her own substance, just as a woman nurses her child. Such an association is therefore
called pregnancy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עיבור‎</span>), because the stronger soul gives as it were life and substance to the weaker companion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4006src" href="#xd31e4006">23</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the world, like all other living beings, is a further expansion of the Deity’s
own substance, it too must ultimately share that blessedness which it enjoyed in its
first evolution. This is indicated in the letter <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב‎</span> with which the history of the creation begins (<i>i.e.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב״ראשית‎</span>), and which is also the first letter in the word <i>blessing</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב״רכה‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4061src" href="#xd31e4061">24</a> Even the archangel of wickedness, or the <i>venomous beast</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חוייא בישא‎</span>), or Samäel (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סמאל‎</span>), as he is called, will be restored to his angelic nature and name, inasmuch as he
too, like all other beings, proceeded from the same infinite source of all things.
The first part of his name (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סﬦ‎</span>), which signifies <i>venom</i>, will then be dropped, and he will retain the second part (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אל‎</span>), which is the common name of all the angels. This, however, will only take place
at the advent of Messiah. But his coming is retarded by the very few new souls which
enter into the world; as many of the old souls which have already inhabited bodies
have to reenter those bodies which are now born, in consequence of having polluted
themselves in their previous bodily existence, and the soul of the Messiah, which,
like other souls, has its pre-existence in the world of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, cannot be born till all human souls have passed through their period of probation
on this earth, because it is to be the last born one at the end of days. Then the
great Jubilee year will commence, when the whole pleroma of souls (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוצר הנשמות‎</span>), cleaned and purified shall return into the bosom of the Infinite Source; and they
shall be in “the Palace which is situate in the secret and most elevated part of heaven,
and which is called the <i>Palace of Love</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכל אהבה‎</span>). There the profoundest mysteries are; there dwells the Heavenly King, blessed be
he, with the holy souls, and is united with them by a loving kiss. <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>(<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 97 <i>a</i>.) “This kiss is the union of the soul with the substance from which it emanated.”
(<i>Ibid.</i>, i, 168 <i>a</i>.) Then hell shall disappear; there shall be no more punishment, nor temptation, nor
sin: life will be an everlasting feast, a Sabbath without end. Then all souls will
be united with the Highest Soul, and supplement each other in the Holy of Holies of
the Seven Halls (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע היכלות‎</span>). Everything will then return to unity and perfection—everything will be united into
one idea, which shall be over, and fill the whole universe. The basis of this idea,
however (<i>i.e.</i>, the light which is concealed in it), will never be fathomed or comprehended; only
the idea itself which emanates from it shall be comprehended. In that state the creature
will not be distinguished from the Creator, the same idea will illuminate both. Then
the soul will rule the universe like God, and what she shall command he will execute.
(<i>Sohar</i>, i, 45 <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>V. <i>The Kabbalistic view of the Old Testament, and its relation to Christianity.</i>
</p>
<p>We have already seen that the Kabbalah claims a pre-Adamite existence, and asserts
that its mysteries are covertly conveyed in the first four books of the Pentateuch.
Those of us who read the Books of Moses, and cannot discover in them any of the above-mentioned
doctrines, will naturally ask for the principles of exegesis whereby these secrets
are deduced from or rather introduced into the text. These principles are laid down
in the following declaration:—“If the Law simply consisted of ordinary expressions
and narratives, <i>e. gr.</i>, the words of Esau, Hagar, Laban, the ass of Balaam, or of Balaam himself, why should
it be called the Law of truth, the perfect Law, the true witness of God? Each word
contains a sublime source, each narrative points not only to the single instance in
question, but also to generals.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 149 <i>b</i>.) “Woe be to the son of man who says that the <i>Tora</i> (Pentateuch) contains common sayings <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>and ordinary narratives.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4145src" href="#xd31e4145">25</a> For, if this were the case, we might in the present day compose a code of doctrines
from profane writings which should excite greater respect. If the Law contains ordinary
matter, then there are nobler sentiments in profane codes. Let us go and make a selection
from them, and we shall be able to compile a far superior code.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4178src" href="#xd31e4178">26</a> But <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>every word of the Law has a sublime sense and a heavenly mystery.… Now the spiritual
angels had to put on an earthly garment when they descended to this earth; and if
they had not put on such a garment, they could neither have remained nor be understood
on the earth. And just as it was with the angels so it is with the Law. When it descended
on earth, the Law had to put on an earthly garment to be understood by us, and the
narratives are its garment. There are some who think that this garment is the real
Law, and not the spirit which it clothed, but these have no portion in the world to
come; and it is for this reason that David prayed, ‘Open thou mine eyes that I may
behold the wondrous things out of the Law.’ ( Ps. cxix, 18 .) What is under the garment of the Law? There is the garment which every one can
see; and there are foolish people who, when they see a well-dressed man, think of
nothing more worthy than this beautiful garment, and take it for the body, whilst
the worth of the body itself consists in the soul. The Law too has a body: this is
the commandments, which are called the body of the Law. This body is clothed in garments,
which are the ordinary narratives. The fools of this world look at nothing else but
this garment, which consists of the narratives in the Law; they do not know any more,
and do not understand what is beneath this garment. But those who have more understanding
do not look at the garment but at the body beneath it (<i>i.e.</i>, the moral); whilst the wisest, the servants of the Heavenly King, those who dwell
at Mount Sinai, look at nothing else but the soul (<i>i.e.</i>, the secret doctrine), which is the root of all the real Law, and these are destined
in the world to come to behold the <i>Soul of this Soul</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the Deity), which breathes in the Law.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 152 <i>a</i>.)
<span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>The opinion that the mysteries of the Kabbalah are to be found in the garment of the
Pentateuch is still more systematically propounded in the following parable. “Like
a beautiful woman, concealed in the interior of her palace, who when her friend and
beloved passes by, opens for a moment a secret window and is seen by him alone, and
then withdraws herself immediately and disappears for a long time, so the doctrine
only shows herself to the chosen (<i>i.e.</i>, to him who is devoted to her with body and soul); and even to him not always in
the same manner. At first she simply beckons at the passer-by with her hand, and it
generally depends upon his understanding this gentle hint. This is the interpretation
known by the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רמז‎</span>. Afterwards she approaches him a little closer, lisps him a few words, but her form
is still covered with a thick veil, which his looks cannot penetrate. This is the
so called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דרוש‎</span>. She then converses with him with her face covered by a thin veil; this is the enigmatic
language of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגדה‎</span>. After having thus become accustomed to her society, she at last shows herself face
to face and entrusts him with the innermost secrets of her heart. This is the secret
of the Law, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוד‎</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4260src" href="#xd31e4260">27</a> He who is thus far initiated in the mysteries <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>of the <i>Tora</i> will understand that all those profound secrets are based upon the simply literal
sense, and are in harmony with it; and from this literal sense not a single iota is
to be taken and nothing to be added to it.” (<i>Sohar</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e4329" title="Not in source">,</span> ii, 99.)
</p>
<p>This fourfold sense is gradually disclosed to the initiated in the mysteries of the
Kabbalah by the application of definite hermeneutical rules, which chiefly affect
the letters composing the words. The most prominent of these canons are—
</p>
<p>I. Every letter of a word is reduced to its numerical value, and the word is explained
by another of the same quantity. Thus from the words “<i>Lo! three men stood by him</i>” ( Gen. xviii, 2 ), it is deduced that these three angels were <i>Michael</i>, <i>Gabriel</i>, and <i>Raphael</i>, because <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏והנה שלשה‎</span> <i>and lo! three men</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלו מיכאל גבריאל ורפאל‎</span> <i>these are Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael</i>, are of the same numerical value, as will be seen from the following reduction to
their numerical value of both these phrases.

<p>This rule in called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמטריא‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גרמטיא‎</span> which is a metathesis of the Greek word <span class="trans" title="gramma, grammeia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">γράμμα, γραμμεία</span></span>, or <span class="trans" title="grammateia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">γραμματεία</span></span> in the sense of numbers as represented by letters.
</p>
<p>2. Every letter of a word is taken as an initial or abbreviation of a word. Thus every
letter of the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית‎</span>, the first word in Genesis, is made the initial of a word, and we obtain <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="xl">ב</span>ראשית <span class="xl">ר</span>אה <span class="xl">א</span>להים <span class="xl">ש</span>יקבלו <span class="xl">י</span>שראל <span class="xl">ת</span>ורה‎</span> <i>in the beginning God saw that Israel would accept the Law</i>. This rule is <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>denominated <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוטריקון‎</span> = <i lang="la">notaricun</i>, from <i lang="la">notarius</i>, a shorthand writer, one who among the Romans belonged to that class of writers who
abbreviated and used single letters to signify whole words.
</p>
<p>3. The initial and final letters of several words are respectively formed into separate
words. Thus from the beginnings and ends of the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מי יעלה לנו השמימה‎</span> <i>who shall go up for us to heaven?</i> ( Deut. xxx, 12 ) are obtained <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מילה‎</span> <i>circumcision</i> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span> <i>Jehovah</i>, and inferred that God ordained circumcision as the way to heaven.
</p>
<p>4. Two words occurring in the same verse are joined together and made into one. Thus
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מי‎</span> <i>who</i> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלה‎</span> <i>these</i> are made into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהיﬦ‎</span> <i>God</i> by transposing the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span>. <i lang="la">Vide supra</i>, <i>p.</i> 94.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4796src" href="#xd31e4796">28</a>
</p>
<p>5. The words of those verses which are regarded as containing a peculiar recondite
meaning are ranged in squares in such a manner as to be read either vertically or
boustrophedonally, beginning at the right or left hand. Again the words of several
verses are placed over each other, and the letters which stand under each other are
formed into new words. This is especially seen in the treatment of three verses in
Exod. xiv , (viz., 19–21 ), which are believed to <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>contain the three Pillars of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, and the Divine Name of seventy-two words. The following tables will illustrate this
principle of interpretation. The first of these three verses <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ויסע מלאך האלהים ההלך לפני מחנה ישראל וילך מאחריהם ויסע עמוד הענן מפניהם ויעמד מאחריהם‎</span>, <i>and the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind
them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them</i> ( Exod. xiv, 19 ), is read boustrophedonally, as follows:—

<p>6. The letters of words are changed by way of anagram and new words are obtained.
This canon is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תמורה‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חילוף אותיות‎</span>, <i>permutation</i>, and the commutation is effected according to fixed rules. Thus the alphabet is bent
exactly <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>in the middle, and one half is put over the other, and by changing alternately the
first letter or the first two letters at the beginning of the second line, twenty-two
commutations are produced <i>ex. gr.</i>:—

<p>Besides these canons the Kabbalah also sees a recondite sense in the form of the letters,
as well as in the ornaments which adorn them.
</p>
<p>As to the relation of the Kabbalah to Christianity, it is maintained that this theosophy
propounds the doctrine of the trinity and the sufferings of Messiah. How far this
is true may be ascertained from the following passages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8201src" href="#xd31e8201">30</a> “We have already remarked in several places that the daily liturgical declaration
about the divine unity is that which is indicated in the Bible ( Deut. vi, 43 ), where <i>Jehovah</i> occurs first, then <i>Elohenu</i>, and then again <i>Jehovah</i>, which three together constitute a unity, and for this reason he [<i>i.e.</i>, Jehovah] is in the said place called one (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחד‎</span>), But there are three names, and how can they be one? And although we read one (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחד‎</span>), are they really one? Now this is revealed by the vision of the Holy Ghost, and
when the eyes are closed we get to know that the three are only one. This is also
the mystery of the voice. The voice is only one, find yet it consists of three elements,
fire [<i>i.e.</i>, warmth], air [<i>i.e.</i>, breath], and water [<i>i.e.</i>, humidity], yet are all these one in the mystery of the voice, and can only be one.
Thus also Jehovah, Elohenu, and Jehovah constitute one—three forms which are one.
And this is indicated by the voice which man raises [<i>i.e.</i>, at prayer], thereby to comprehend spiritually the most perfect unity of the <i>En Soph</i> for the finite, since all the three [<i>i.e.</i>, Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah] are rend with the same loud voice, which comprises in
itself a trinity. And this is the daily confession of the divine unity which, as a
mystery, is revealed by the Holy Ghost. This unity has been explained <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>in different ways, yet he who understands it in this way is right, and he who understands
it in another way is also right. The idea of unity, however formed by us here below,
from the mystery of the audible voice which is one, explains the thing.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 43 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>On another occasion we are informed that R. Eleazar, whilst sitting with his father
R. Simeon, was anxious to know how the two names, <i>Jehovah</i> and <i>Elohim</i>, can be interchanged, seeing that the one denotes <i>mercy</i> and the other <i>judgment</i>. Before giving the discussion between the father and the son, it is necessary to
remark that whenever the two divine names, Adonai (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדוני‎</span>) and Jehovah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>), immediately follow each other, <i>Jehovah</i> is pointed and read (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְהֹוִה‎</span>) <i>Elohim</i>. The reason of this, as it is generally supposed, is to avoid the repetition of Adonai,
Adonai, since the Tetragrammaton is otherwise always pointed and read (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְהֹוָה‎</span>). The Kabbalah, however, as we shall see, discovers in it a recondite meaning,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8271src" href="#xd31e8271">31</a> “R. Eleazar, when sitting before his father R. Simeon, said to him, we have been
taught that whenever <i>Elohim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהיﬦ‎</span>) occurs, it denotes <i>Justice</i>. Now how can <i>Elohim</i> sometimes be put for <i>Jehovah</i>, as is the case in those passages wherein <i>Adonai</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדוני‎</span>) and <i>Jehovah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>) stand together (Comp. Gen. xv, 8 ; Ezek. ii, 4 , &amp;c.), seeing that the latter denotes <i>mercy</i> in all the passages in which it occurs? To which he replied, Thus it is said in the
Scripture, ‘Know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart, that <i>Jehovah</i> is <i>Elohim</i>’ ( Deut<span class="corr" id="xd31e8315" title="Not in source">.</span> iv, 19 ); and again it is written ‘<i>Jehovah</i> is <i>Elohim</i>.’ (<i>Ibid.</i>, ver. 35 .) Whereupon he [<i>i.e.</i>, the son] said, I know this forsooth, that justice is sometimes tempered with <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>mercy and mercy with justice. Quoth he [<i>i.e.</i>, the father], Come and see that it is so; Jehovah indeed does signify mercy whenever
it occurs, but when through sin mercy is changed into justice, then it is written
Jehovah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>), but read <i>Elohim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהיﬦ‎</span>). Now come and see the mystery of the word [<i>i.e.</i>, Jehovah]. There are three degrees, and each degree exists by itself [<i>i.e.</i>, in the Deity], although the three together constitute one, they are closely united
into one and are inseparable from each other.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 65 <i>a</i>.)
</p>
<p>We shall only give one more passage bearing on the subject of the Trinity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8353src" href="#xd31e8353">32</a> “He who reads the word (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחד‎</span>) <i>One</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, in the declaration of the divine unity <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמע‎</span>] must pronounce <i>the Aleph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span>) quickly, shorten its sound a little, and not pause at all by this letter, and he
who obeys this, his life will be lengthened. Whereupon they [<i>i.e.</i>, the disciples] said to him [<i>i.e.</i>, to R. Ilai], he [<i>i.e.</i>, R. Simeon] has said, There are two, and one is connected with them, and they are
three; but in being three they are one. He said to them, those two names, Jehovah
Jehovah, are in the declaration ‘Hear O Israel’ ( Deut. vi, 4 ), and <i>Elohenu</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהנו‎</span>), between them, is united with them as the third, and this is the conclusion which
is sealed with the impression of <i>Truth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמת‎</span>). But when these three are combined into a unity, they are one in a single unity.”
(<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 262 <i>a</i>.) Indeed one Codex of the <i>Sohar</i> had the following remark on the words “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts” ( Isa. iv, 3 ); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדוש זה אב קדוש זה בן קדוש זה רוח <span class="corr" id="xd31e8405" title="Source: הקךש">הקדש</span>‎</span>, <i>the first holy refers to the Holy Father; the second to the Holy Son; and the third
to the Holy <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>Ghost.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8414src" href="#xd31e8414">33</a> This passage, however, is omitted from the present recensions of the <i>Sohar</i>. Some Jewish writers have felt these passages to be so favourable to the doctrine
of the Trinity, that they insist upon their being interpolations into the <i>Sohar</i>, whilst others have tried to explain them as referring to the <i>Sephiroth</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8444src" href="#xd31e8444">34</a>
</p>
<p>As to the atonement of the Messiah for the sins of the people, this is not only propounded
in the <i>Sohar</i>, but is given as the explanation of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8454src" href="#xd31e8454">35</a> “When the righteous are visited with sufferings and afflictions to atone for the
sins of the world, it is that they might atone for all the sins of this generation.
How is this proved? By all the members of the body. When all members suffer, one member
is afflicted in order that all may recover. And which of them? The arm. The arm is
beaten, the blood is taken from it, and then the recovery of all the members of the
body is secured. So it is with the children of the world: they are members one of
another. When the Holy One; blessed be he, wishes the recovery of the world, he afflicts
one righteous from their midst, and for his sake all are healed. How is this shown?
It is written—‘He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities,
… and with his stripes we are healed.’ ( Isa. liii, 5 .) ‘With his stripes,’ <i>i.e.</i>, healed, as by the wound of bleeding an arm, and with this wound we are healed, <i>i.e.</i>, it was a healing to <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>each one of us as members of the body.” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 218 <i>a</i>.) To the same effect is the following passage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8472src" href="#xd31e8472">36</a> “Those souls which tarry in the nether garden of Eden hover about the world, and
when they see suffering or patient martyrs and those who suffer for the unity of God,
they return and mention it to the Messiah. When they tell the Messiah of the afflictions
of Israel in exile, and that the sinners among them do not reflect in order to know
their Lord, he raises his voice and weeps because of those sinners, as it is written,
‘he is wounded for our transgressions.’ ( Isa. liii, 5 .) Whereupon those souls return and take their place. In the garden of Eden there
is one palace which is called the palace of the sick. The Messiah goes into this palace
and invokes all the sufferings, pain, and afflictions of Israel to come upon him,
and they all come upon him. Now if he did not remove them thus and take them upon
himself, no man could endure the sufferings of Israel, due as punishment for transgressing
the Law; as it is written—‘Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,<span class="corr" id="xd31e8479" title="Not in source">’</span> &amp;c. ( Isa. liii, 4 , with Rom. xii, 3, 4 .) When the children of Israel were in the Holy Land they removed all those sufferings
and afflictions from the world by their prayers and sacrifices, but now the Messiah
removes them from the world.” (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 212 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>That these opinions favour, to a certain extent, the doctrines of the Trinity and
the Atonement, though not in the orthodox sense, is not only admitted by many of the
Jewish literati who are adverse to the Kabbalah, but by some of its <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>friends. Indeed, the very fact that so large a number of Kabbalists have from time
to time embraced the Christian faith would of itself show that there must be some
sort of affinity between the tenets of the respective systems. Some of these converts
occupied the highest position in the Synagogue, both as pious Jews and literary men.
We need only specify Paul Ricci, physician to the Emperor Maximilian I; Julius Conrad
Otto, author of <i>The Unveiled Secrets</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גלא רזיא‎</span>), consisting of extracts from the <i>Talmud</i> and the <i>Sohar</i>, to prove the validity of the Christian doctrine (Nürenberg, 1805); John Stephen
Rittengal, grandson of the celebrated Don Isaac Abravanel, and translator of <i>The Book Jetzira</i>, or <i>of Creation</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר יצירה‎</span>), into Latin (Amsterdam, 1642); and Jacob Frank, the great apostle of the Kabbalah
in the eighteenth century, whose example in professing Christianity was followed by
several thousands of his disciples.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8513src" href="#xd31e8513">37</a> The testimony of these distinguished Kabbalists, which they give in their elaborate
works, about the affinity of some of the doctrines of this theosophy with those of
Christianity, is by no means to be slighted; and this is fully corroborated by the
celebrated Leo di Modena, who, as an orthodox Jew, went so far as to question whether
God will ever forgive those who printed the Kabbalistic works.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8519src" href="#xd31e8519">38</a>
</p>
<p>The use made by some well-meaning Christians of the above-named Kabbalistic canons
of interpretation, in controversies with Jews, to prove that the doctrines of Christianity
are concealed under the letter of the Old Testament, will now be deprecated by every
one who has any regard for the laws of language. As a literary curiosity, however,
we shall give one or two specimens. No less a person than the celebrated <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>Reuchlin would have it that the doctrine of the Trinity is to be found in the first
verse of Genesis. He submits, if the Hebrew word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברא‎</span>, which is translated <i>created</i>, be examined, and if each of the three letters composing this word be taken as the
initial of a separate word, we obtain the expressions <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בן רוח אב‎</span> <i>Son</i>, <i>Spirit</i>, <i>Father</i>, according to Rule 2 (p. <a href="#pb131" class="pageref">131</a>). Upon the same principle this erudite scholar deduces the first two persons in the
Trinity from the words—“the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner” ( Ps. cxviii, 22 ), by dividing the three letters composing the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבן‎</span> <i>stone</i>, into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אב בן‎</span> <i>Father</i>, <i>Son</i> (Comp. <i lang="la">De Verbo <span class="corr" id="xd31e8567" title="Source: mirifico">Mirifico</span></i>, Basel, 1494). In more recent times we find it maintained that the ‘<i>righteousness</i>’ spoken of in Daniel ix, 24 , means <i>the Anointed of Jehovah</i>, because the original phrase, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדק עלמים‎</span> is by Gematria, = numerical value, (which is Rule 1, given above, p. <a href="#pb131" class="pageref">131</a>), the same as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משיח יהוה‎</span>. So pleased is the author with this discovery, that he takes great care to remark—“It
is a proof which I believe has hitherto escaped the notice of interpreters.” Such
proofs, however, of the Messiaship of Christ bring no honour to our religion; and
in the present day argue badly both against him who adduces them and against him who
is convinced by them.

it has been propounded by the Jews from time immemorial, before the Kabbalah came
into existence, as may be seen from the following passage in <i>the Midrash</i>. “The Holy One, blessed be he, is the space of the universe, but the universe is
not his space (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הקב״ה מקומו של עולם ואין העולם מקומו‎</span>). R. Isaac submitted: from the passage <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעונה אלהי קדם‎</span> ( Deut. xxxiii, 27 ), we do not know whether the Holy One, blessed be he, is the habitation of the universe
or the universe his habitation; but from the remark <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדני מעון אתה‎</span> <i>Lord thou art the dwelling place</i> ( Ps. xc, 1 ), it is evident that the Holy One, blessed be he, is the dwelling place of the universe,
and not the universe his dwelling place.” (<i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, § lxviii.) To the same effect is the remark of Philo, “God himself is the space
of the universe, for it is he who contains all things.” (<i lang="la">De Somniis</i>, i.)

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e3051src">11</a></span> The Kabbalistic description of <i>Metatron</i> is taken from the Jewish angelology of a much older date than this theosophy. Thus
Ben Asai and Ben Soma already regard <i>the divine voice</i>, the <span class="trans" title="logos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λόγος</span></span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קול אלהים‎</span>) as Metatron. (<i>Beresh. Rab.</i>, Parsha v.) He is called <i>the Great Teacher</i>, <i>the Teacher of Teachers</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספרא רבא‎</span>), and it is for this reason that Enoch, who walked in close communion with God, and
taught mankind by his holy example, is said by the Chaldee paraphrase of Jonathan
b. Uzziel, to ‘have received the name <i>Metatron, the Great Teacher</i>’ after he was transplanted. ( Gen. v, 24 .) Metatron, moreover, is the Presence Angel (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שר הפנים‎</span>), the Angel of the Lord that was sent to go before Israel ( Exod. xxiii, 21 ); he is the visible manifestation of the Deity, for in him is the name of the Lord,
<i>i.e.</i>, his name and that of the Deity are identical, inasmuch as they are of the same numerical
value (viz.:—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שדי‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטטרון‎</span> are the same according to the exegetical rule called Gematria, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> 10 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ד‎</span> 4 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span> 300 = 314; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ן‎</span> 50 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span> 6 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ר‎</span> 200 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ט‎</span> 9 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ט‎</span> 9 + <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span> 40 = 314. See Rashi on Exod. xxiii, 21 , <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רבותינו אמרו זה מטטרון ששמו כשם רבו מטטרון בגמטריא שדי‎</span> and <i>Sanhedrim</i> 38 <i>b</i>). So exalted is Metatron’s position in the ancient Jewish angelology, that we are
told that when Elisha b. Abaja, also called Acher, saw this angel who occupies the
first position after the Deity, he exclaimed, ‘Peradventure, but far be it, there
are two Supreme Powers’ (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמא חס ושלום שתי רשויות הן‎</span> <i>Talmud</i>, <i>Chagiga</i>, 15 <i>a</i>). The etymology of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטטרון‎</span> is greatly disputed; but there is no doubt that it is to be derived from <span class="sc">Metator</span>, <i>messenger</i>, <i>outrider</i>, <i>way maker</i>, as has been shown by Elias Levita, and is maintained by Cassel (<i lang="de">Ersch und Gruber’s Encyklopädie</i>, section ii, vol. xxvii, <i>s.v.</i>; <span class="sc" lang="de">Juden</span>, p. 40, note 84). Sachs (<i lang="de">Beiträge zur Sprach- und Alterthumsforschung</i>, vol. i, Berlin 1852, p. 108) rightly remarks that this etymology is fixed by the
passage from <i>Siphra</i>, quoted in <i>Kaphter-Va-Pherach</i>, c. x, p. 34 <i>b</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אצבעו של הקב״ה נעשה מטטרון למשה והראהו כל ארץ ישראל‎</span> <i>the finger of God was the messenger or guide to Moses, and showed him all the land

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e4006src">23</a></span> According to Josephus, the doctrine of the transmigration of souls into other bodies
(<span class="trans" title="metempsychōsis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">μετεμψύχωσις</span></span>), was also held by the Pharisees (comp. Antiq. xviii, 1, 3: de Bell. Jud. ii, 8,
14), restricting, however, the metempsychosis to the righteous. And though the Midrashim
and the Talmud are silent about it, yet from Saadia’s vituperations against it (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבל אומר שמצאתי אנשים ממי שנקראים יהודים אומרים בהשנות וקוראים אותו ההעתקח‎</span> <i>Emunoth ve-Deoth</i>, vi, 7; viii, 3) there is no doubt that this doctrine was held among some Jews in
the ninth century of the present era. At all events it is perfectly certain that the
Karaite Jews firmly believed in it ever since the seventh century. (Comp. Frankel,
<i lang="de">Monatschrift</i>, x, 177, &amp;c.) St. Jerome assures us that it was also propounded among the early Christians
as an esoteric and traditional doctrine which was entrusted to the select few, (<i lang="la">abscondite quasi in foveis viperarum versari et quasi haereditario malo serpere in
paucis</i>. Comp. epist. ad Demedriadem); and Origen was convinced that it was only by means
of this doctrine that certain Scriptural narratives, such as the struggle of Jacob
with Esau before their birth, the reference about Jeremiah when still in his mother’s
womb, and many others, can possibly be explained<span class="corr" id="xd31e4028" title="Source: ,">.</span> (<span class="trans" title="peri archōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">περὶ ἀρχῶν</span></span> i, 1, cap. vii; <i lang="la">Adver.

letter, is already propounded in the Midrash, as may be seen from the following remark.
The reason why the Law begins with <i>Beth</i>, the second letter of the Alphabet, and not with <i>Aleph</i>, the first letter, is that the former is the first letter in the word <i>blessing</i>, while the latter is the first letter in the word <i>accursed</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏למה בבית מפני שהוא לשון ברכה ולא בא״לף שהוא לשון ארירה‎</span> (<i>Midrash Rabba</i>, sec. i).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e4061src" title="Return to note 24 in text.">↑</a></p>

must contain a spiritual meaning concealed under the garment of the letter, is not
peculiar to the Kabbalah. Both the Synagogue and the Church have maintained the same
from time immemorial. Thus the Talmud already describes the impious Manasseh, King
of Israel, as making himself merry over the narratives of the Pentateuch and ironically
asking (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנשוה בן חזקיה שהיה יושב ודורש בהגדות של דופי אמר וכי לא היה לו למשה לכתוב אלא אחות

was Timna” ( Gen. xxxvi, 22 ); “Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz” (<i>ibid<span class="corr" id="xd31e4159" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, v. 12 ); that “Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the
field” (<i>ibid.</i>, xxx, 14 ), &amp;c, &amp;c. And it is replied that these narratives contain another sense besides the
literal one. (<i>Sanhedrim</i>, 99 <i>b</i>.) Hence the rule (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל מה שאירע לאבות סימן לבנים‎</span>), what happened to the fathers is typical of the children.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e4145src" title="Return to note 25 in text.">↑</a></p>

the first, second, and third day, in connection with which morning and evening are
mentioned, were without sun, moon and stars, nay that there was no sky on the first
day? Who is there so foolish and without common sense as to believe that God planted
trees in the garden eastward of Eden like a husbandman, and planted therein the tree
of life, perceptible to the eyes and senses, which gave life to the eater thereof;
and another tree which gave to the eater thereof a knowledge of good and evil? I believe
that everybody must regard these as figures, under which a recondite sense is concealed.”
Lib. iv, cap. ii, <span class="trans" title="peri archōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">περὶ ἀρχῶν</span></span>. Huet, <i>Origeniana</i>, p. 167. Comp. Davidson, <i>Sacred Hermeneutics</i>, Edinburgh, 1843, p. 99, &amp;c. It must, however, not be supposed that this sort of
interpretation, which defies all rules of sound exegesis and common sense, is confined
to the ancient Jewish Rabbins or the Christian fathers. The Commentary on Genesis
and Exodus by Chr. Wordsworth, D.D., Canon of Westminster, may fairly compete in this
respect with any production of bygone days. Will it be believed that Dr. Wordsworth
actually sees it “<i>suggested by the Holy Spirit Himself</i>,” that Noah drunk, exposing his nakedness, and mocked by his own child, Ham, is typical
of Christ who drank the cup of God’s wrath, stripped Himself of His heavenly glory,
and was mocked by his own children the Jews? But we must give the Canon’s own words.
“Noah drank the wine of his vineyard; Christ drank the cup of God’s wrath, which was
the fruit of the sin of the cultivators of the vineyard, which he had planted in the
world. Noah was made naked to his shame; Christ consented for our sake to strip Himself
of His heavenly glory, and took on him the form of a servant. ( Phil. ii, 7 .) He laid aside his garments, and washed his disciples’ feet ( John, xiii, 4 .) He hid not his face from shame and spitting. ( Isa. 1, 6 .) When he was on the Cross, they that passed by reviled Him. ( Matt. xxvii, 39 .) He was mocked by His <span class="pageNum" id="pb129n">[<a href="#pb129n">129</a>]</span>own children, the Jews. He deigned to be exposed to insult for our sakes, in shame
and nakedness on the Cross ( Heb. xii, 2 ), in order that we might receive eternal glory from His shame, and be clothed through
His weakness with garments of heavenly beauty.” (<i>Commentary on Genesis and Exodus</i>, London, 1864, p. 52.)&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e4178src" title="Return to note 26 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e4260src">27</a></span> The notion that the Bible is to be explained in this fourfold manner was also propounded
by the Jewish doctors generally, long before the existence of the Kabbalah (Comp.
Ginsburg, <i>Historical and Critical Commentary on Ecclesiastes</i>, Longman, 1861, p. 30), and has been adopted by some of the fathers and schoolmen.
Origen, although only advocating a threefold sense, viz.:—<span class="trans" title="sōmatikos, psychikos, pneumatikos"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e4268" title="Source: σὼματικὸς">σωματικὸς</span>, ψυχικὸς, πνευματικὸς</span></span>, to correspond to the Platonic notion of the component parts of man, viz.:—<span class="trans" title="sōma, psychē, pneuma"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σῶμα, ψυχὴ, πνεῦμα</span></span>, almost uses the same words as the Kabbalah. “The sentiments of Holy Scriptures must
be imprinted upon each one’s soul in a threefold manner, that the more simple may
be built up by the <i>flesh</i> (or body) of Scripture, so to speak, by which we mean the obvious explanation; that
he who has advanced to a higher state may be edified by the <i>soul</i> of Scripture as it were; but he that is perfect, and like to the individuals spoken
of by the Apostle ( 1 Cor. ii, 6 , 7), must be edified by the spiritual law, having a shadow of good things to come.

respecting Habakkuk, who, as Isaiah foresaw, would in coming days use the very words
here predicted. (Comp. Isa. xxi, 8, 9 , with Hab. ii, 1 ); and this interpretation is obtained by rule i; inasmuch as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אריה‎</span> <i>lion</i> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חבקוק‎</span> <i>Habakkuk</i> are numerically the same, viz.:—

<p class="first">We now proceed to trace the date and origin of the Kabbalah. Taking the <i>ex parte</i> statement for what it is worth, viz., that this secret doctrine is of a pre-Adamite
date, and that God himself propounded it to the angels in Paradise, we shall have
to examine the age of the oldest documents which embody its tenets, and compare these
doctrines with other systems, in order to ascertain the real date and origin of this
theosophy. But before this is done, it will be necessary to summarize, as briefly
as possible, those doctrines which are peculiar to the Kabbalah, or which it expounds
and elaborates in an especial manner, and which constitute it a separate system within
the precincts of Judaism. The doctrines are as follow:—
</p>
<p>1. God is boundless in his nature. He has neither will, intention, desire, thought,
language, nor action. He cannot be grasped and depicted; and, for this reason, is
called <i>En Soph</i>, and as such he is in a certain sense not existent.
</p>
<p>2. He is not the direct creator of the universe, since he could not will the creation;
and since a creation proceeding directly from him would have to be as boundless and
as perfect as he is himself.
</p>
<p>3. He at first sent forth ten emanations, or <i>Sephiroth</i>, which are begotten, not made, and which are both infinite and finite.
</p>
<p>4. From these <i>Sephiroth</i>, which are the Archetypal Man, the different worlds gradually and successively evolved.
These evolutionary worlds are the brightness and the express image of their progenitors,
the <i>Sephiroth</i>, which uphold all things.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>5. These emanations, or <i>Sephiroth</i>, gave rise to or created in their own image all human souls. These souls are pre-existent,
they occupy a special hall in the upper world of spirits, and there already decide
whether they will pursue a good or bad course in their temporary sojourn in the human
body, which is also fashioned according to the Archetypal image.
</p>
<p>6. No one has seen the <i>En Soph</i> at any time. It is the <i>Sephiroth</i>, in whom the <i>En Soph</i> is incarnate, who have revealed themselves to us, and to whom the anthropomorphisms
of Scripture and the <i>Hagada</i> refer. Thus when it is said, “God spake, descended upon earth, ascended into heaven,
smelled the sweet smell of sacrifices, repented in his heart, was angry,” &amp;c, &amp;c,
or when the Hagadic works describe the body and the mansions of the Deity, &amp;c., all
this does not refer to the <i>En Soph</i>, but to these intermediate beings.
</p>
<p>7. It is an absolute condition of the soul to return to the Infinite Source whence
it emanated, after developing all those perfections the germs of which are indelibly
inherent in it. If it fails to develope these germs, it must migrate into another
body, and in case it is still too weak to acquire the virtues for which it is sent
to this earth, it is united to another and a stronger soul, which, occupying the same
human body with it, aids its weaker companion in obtaining the object for which it
came down from the world of spirits.
</p>
<p>8. When all the pre-existent souls shall have passed their probationary period here
below, the restitution of all things will take place; Satan will be restored to an
angel of light, hell will disappear, and all souls will return into the bosom of the
Deity whence they emanated. The creature shall not then be distinguished from the
Creator. Like God, the soul will rule the universe: she shall command, and God obey.
</p>
<p>With these cardinal doctrines before us we shall now be <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>able to examine the validity of the Kabbalists’ claims to the books which, according
to them, propound their doctrines and determine the origin of this theosophy. Their
works are I. <i>The Book of Creation</i>; II. <i>The Sohar</i>; and III. <i>The Commentary of the Ten Sephiroth</i>. As the <i>Book of Creation</i> is acknowledged by all parties to be the Oldest, we shall examine it first.
</p>
<p>I. <i>The Book of Creation</i> or <i>Jetzira</i>.
</p>
<p>This marvellous and famous document pretends to be a monologue of the patriarch Abraham,
and premises that the contemplations it contains are those which led the father of
the Hebrews to abandon the worship of the stars and to embrace the faith of the true
God. Hence the remark of the celebrated philosopher, R. Jehudah Ha-Levi (born about
1086)—“The Book of the Creation, which belongs to our father Abraham, … demonstrates
the existence of the Deity and the Divine Unity, by things which are on the one hand
manifold and multifarious, whilst on the other hand they converge and harmonize; and
this harmony can only proceed from One who originated it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8650src" href="#xd31e8650">1</a> (<i>Khozari</i>, iv. 25.) The whole Treatise consists of six <i>Perakim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרקיﬦ‎</span>) or chapters, subdivided into thirty-three very brief <i>Mishnas</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משנות‎</span>) or sections, as follows. The first chapter has twelve sections, the second has five,
the third five, the fourth four, the fifth three, and the sixth four sections. The
doctrines which it propounds are delivered in the style of aphorisms or theorems,
and, pretending to be the dicta of Abraham, are laid down very dogmatically, in a
manner becoming the authority of this patriarch.
</p>
<p>As has already been intimated, the design of this treatise is to exhibit a system
whereby the universe may be viewed methodically in connection with the truths given
in the Bible, <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>thus shewing, from the gradual and systematic development of the creation, and from
the harmony which prevails in all its multitudinous component parts, that One God
produced it all, and that He is over all. The order in which God gave rise to this
creation out of nothing (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יצר ממש מתוהו‎</span>), and the harmony which pervades all the constituent parts of the universe are shown
by the analogy which subsists between the visible things and the signs of thought,
or the means whereby wisdom is expressed and perpetuated among men. Since the letters
have no absolute value, nor can they be used as mere forms, but serve as the medium
between essence and form, and like words, assume the relation of form to the real
essence, and of essence to the embryo and unexpressed thought, great value is attached
to these letters, and to the combinations and analogies of which they are capable.
The patriarch Abraham, therefore, employs the double value of the twenty-two letters
of the Hebrew alphabet;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8674src" href="#xd31e8674">2</a> he uses them, both in their phonetic nature and in their sacred character, as expressing
the divine truths of the Scriptures. But, since the Hebrew alphabet is also used as
numerals, which are represented by the fundamental number <i>ten</i>, and since the vowels of the language are also <i>ten</i> in number, this decade is added to the twenty-two letters, and these two kinds of
signs—<i>i.e.</i>, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet and the ten fundamental numbers—are designated
<i>the thirty-two ways of secret wisdom</i>; and the treatise opens with the declaration<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8698src" href="#xd31e8698">3</a>—“By thirty-two paths of secret wisdom, the Eternal, the Lord of Hosts, the God of
Israel, the living God, the King of the Universe, the Merciful and Gracious, the High
and Exalted God, He who inhabiteth eternity, Glorious and Holy is His <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>name, hath created the world by means of (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר‎</span>) numbers, (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספור‎</span>) phonetic language, and writing (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר‎</span>).” (<i>Sepher Jetzira</i>, chapter i; <i>Mishna</i> i.)
</p>
<p>First of all comes the fundamental number ten. This decade is divided into a tetrade
and hexade, and thereby is shown the gradual development of the world out of nothing.
At first there existed nothing except the Divine Substance, with the creative idea
and the articulate creative word as the Spirit or the Holy Spirit, which is one with
the Divine Substance and indivisible. Hence, the Spirit of the living God (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח אלהים חיים‎</span>) stands at the head of all things and is represented by the number <i>one</i>. “One is the spirit of the living God, blessed be His name, who liveth for ever!
voice, spirit, and word, this is the Holy Ghost.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8725src" href="#xd31e8725">4</a> (Chapter i, <i>Mishna</i> ix). From this Spirit the whole universe proceeded in gradual and successive emanations,
in the following order. The creative <i>air</i>, represented by number <i>two</i>, emanated from the Spirit (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח מרוח‎</span>). “In it He engraved the twenty-two letters.” The <i>water</i> again, represented by the number <i>three</i>, proceeded from the air (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מים מרוח‎</span>). “In it He engraved darkness and emptiness, slime and dung.” Whilst the <i>ether</i> or <i>fire</i>, represented by the number <i>four</i>, emanated from the water (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אש ממים‎</span>). “In it He engraved the throne of His glory, the Ophanim, the Seraphim, the sacred
animals, and the ministering angels, and from these three he formed His habitation;
as it is written—‘He maketh the wind his messengers, flaming fire his servants<span class="corr" id="xd31e8756" title="Source: ”">’ ”</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8758src" href="#xd31e8758">5</a> (Cap. i. <i>Mish.</i> ix, x.) These intermediate members between the Creator and the created world sustain
<i>a passive</i> and <i>created</i> relationship to God, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span><i>an acting</i> and <i>creating</i> relationship to the world; so that God is neither in immediate connection with the
created and material universe, nor is His creative fiat hindered by matter.
</p>
<p>Then comes the hexade, each unit of which represents space in the six directions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שש קצוות‎</span>), or the four corners of the world, east, west, north, and south, as well as height
and depth which emanated from the ether, and in the centre of which is the Holy Temple
supporting the whole (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏והיכל הקודש מכוון באמצע‎</span>). The position of the decade is therefore as follows—
</p>
<div class="figure p150width"><img src="images/p150.png" alt="" width="233" height="720"></div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>These constitute the primordial ten, from which the whole universe proceeded.
</p>
<p>And lastly follow “the twenty-two letters, by means of which God, having drawn, hewn,
and weighed them, and having variously changed and put them together, formed the souls
of everything that has been made, and that shall be made.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8788src" href="#xd31e8788">6</a> (Chapter ii, <i>Mishna</i> ii.) These twenty-two letters of the alphabet are then divided into three groups,
consisting respectively of, 1, <i>the three mothers</i>, or <i>fundamental letters</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש אמות‎</span>), 2, <i>seven double</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע כפולות‎</span>) and 3, <i>twelve simple consonants</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שניﬦ עשר פשוטות‎</span>), to deduce therefrom a triad of elements, a heptade of opposites, and a duodecimo
of simple things, in the following manner.
</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem, Shin.</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש אמות אמ״ש‎</span>
</p>
<p>The above-named three primordial elements, viz., ether, water and air, which were
as yet partially ideal and ethereal, became more concrete and palpable in the course
of emanation. Thus the fire developed itself into the visible heaven, the elementary
water thickened into the earth, embracing sea and land, whilst the elementary air
became the atmospheric air. These constitute the three fundamental types of the universe
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש אמות בעולם‎</span>). The three primordial elements also thickened still more in another direction, and
gave birth to a new order of creatures, which constitute the course of the year and
the temperatures. From the ether developed itself heat, from the water emanated cold,
and from the air proceeded the mild temperature which shows itself in the rain or
wet. These constitute the fundamental points of the year (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלש אמות בשנה‎</span>). Whereupon the three primordial elements developed themselves in another direction
again, and gave rise to the human organism. The ether sent forth the human head, which
is the seat of intelligence; the water gave <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>rise to the body, or the abdominal system; whilst the air, which is the central element,
developed itself into the genital organ. These three domains, viz., the macrocosm,
the revolution of time, and the microcosm, which proceeded from the three primordial
elements, are exhibited by the three letters <i>Aleph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span>), <i>Mem</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span>) and <i>Shin</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span>.) Hence it is said that by means of these three letters—which, both in their phonetic
and sacred character, represent the elements, inasmuch as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span>, as a gentle aspirate, and as the initial of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אויר‎</span> <i>air</i>, symbolises <span class="asc">THE AIR</span>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span>, as a labial or mute, and as the initial of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מיﬦ‎</span> <i>water</i>, represents <span class="asc">THE WATER</span>; whilst <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span>, as a sibilant, and as the last letter of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אש‎</span> <i>fire</i>, typifies <span class="asc">THE FIRE</span> (Chapter iii, <i>Mishna</i> iii)—God created
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In the World</i>—The Fire, Water, Air. </li>
<li><i>In Man</i>—The Head, Body, Breast. </li>
<li><i>In the Year</i>—Heat, Cold, Wet. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Seven double consonants—Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Caph, Pe, Resh, Tav</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע כפולות בגדכפרת‎</span>
</p>
<p>The three dominions proceeding from the triad of the primordial elements which emanated
from the unity continued to develope themselves still further. In the macrocosm were
developed the seven planets, in time the seven days, and in the microcosm the seven
sensuous faculties. These are represented by the seven double consonants of the alphabet.
Hence it is said that by means of these seven letters, which are called double because
they have a double pronunciation, being sometimes aspirated and sometimes not, according
to their being with or without the <i>Dagesh</i>, God created—
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In the World</i>—Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. </li>
<li><i>In Man</i>—Wisdom, Riches, Dominion, Life, Favour, Progeny, Peace. </li>
<li><i>In the Year</i>—Sabbath, Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday. </li>
</ul><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>Owing to the opposite = double pronunciation of these seven letters, being hard and
soft, they are also the symbols of the seven opposites (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תמורות‎</span>) in which human life moves, viz., wisdom and ignorance, riches and poverty<span class="corr" id="xd31e8924" title="Not in source">,</span> fruitfulness and barrenness, life and death, liberty and bondage, peace and war,
beauty and deformity. Moreover, they correspond to the seven ends (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבע קצוות‎</span>), above and below, east and west, north and south, and the Holy Place in the centre,
which supports them; and with them God formed the seven heavens, the seven earths
or countries, the seven weeks from the feast of Passover to Pentecost. (Chapter iii,
<i>Mishna</i>, i–v; cap. iv, <i>Mishna</i>, i–iii.)
</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">Twelve simple consonants</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שתיﬦ עשר פשוטות.‎</span>
</p>
<p>The three dominions then respectively developed themselves into twelve parts, the
macrocosm into the twelve signs of the Zodiac, time into twelve months, and the microcosm
into twelve active organs. This is shown by the twelve simple consonants of the alphabet.
Thus it is declared, that by means of the twelve letters, which are <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוז חטי לן סעצק‎</span>, God created the twelve signs of the Zodiac, viz.:—
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>In the World</i>—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus,
Aquarius, Pisces. </li>
<li><i>In Man</i>—The organs of Sight, Hearing, Smelling, Talking, Taste, Copulating, Dealing, Walking,
Thinking, Anger, Laughter, Sleeping. </li>
<li><i>In the Year</i>—The twelve months, viz., Nisan, Jiar, Sivan, Tamus, Ab, Elul, Tishri, Cheshvan, Kislev,
Tebet, Shebat, Adar. (Comp. chapter v, <i>Mishna</i> i.) </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The three dominions continued gradually to develope into that infinite variety of
objects which is perceptible in each. This infinite variety, proceeding from the combination
of a few, is propounded by means of the great diversity of combinations and permutations
of which the whole alphabet is capable. <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>These letters, small in number, being only twenty-two, by their power of <i>combination</i> and <i>transposition</i>, yield an endless number of words and figures, and thus become the types of all the
varied phenomena in the creation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8967src" href="#xd31e8967">7</a> “Just as the twenty-two letters yield two hundred and thirty-one types by combining
<i>Aleph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span>) with all the letters, and all the letters with <i>Aleph</i>; <i>Beth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב‎</span>), with all the letters, and all the letters with <i>Beth</i>, so all the formations and all that is spoken proceed from one name.” (Chapter ii,
<i>Mishna</i>, iv.). The table on the opposite page will shew how the two hundred and thirty-one
types are obtained by the combination of the twenty-two letters.
</p>
<p>The infinite variety in creation is still more strikingly exhibited by permutations,
of which the Hebrew alphabet is capable, and through which an infinite variety of
types is obtained. Hence the remark<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e8990src" href="#xd31e8990">8</a>—“Two letters form two houses, three letters build six houses, four build twenty-four,
five build a hundred and twenty houses, six build seven hundred and twenty houses;
and from thenceforward go out and think what the mouth cannot utter and the ear cannot
hear.” (Chapter iv, <i>Mishna</i> iv.) The following table will show how the letters, by permutation, will yield an
infinite variety.

<p>Accordingly, the material form of the spirit, represented by the twenty-two letters
of the alphabet, is the form of all existing beings. Apart from the three dominions,
the macrocosm, time, and microcosm, it is only the Infinite who can be perceived,
and of whom this triad testifies; for which reason it is denominated “the three true
witnesses.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11870src" href="#xd31e11870">9</a> Each of this triad, notwithstanding its multifariousness, constitutes a system, having
its own centre and dominion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11874src" href="#xd31e11874">10</a> Just as God is the centre of the universe, the heavenly dragon is the centre of the
macrocosm; the foundation of the year is the revolution of the Zodiac; whilst the
centre of the microcosm is the heart.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11878src" href="#xd31e11878">11</a> The first is like a king on his throne, the second is like a king living among his
subjects, and the third is like a king in war. The reason why the heart of man is
like a monarch in the midst of war is, that the twelve principal organs of the human
body<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11882src" href="#xd31e11882">12</a> “are arrayed against each other in battle array; three serve love, three hatred,
three engender life, and three death. The three engendering love are the heart, the
ears and the mouth; the three for enmity are the <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>liver, the gall and the tongue; but God, the faithful King, rules over all the three
systems. One [<i>i.e.</i>, God] is over the three, the three are over the seven, the seven over the twelve,
and all are internally connected with each other.” (Chapter vi, <i>Mishna</i> iii.) Thus the whole creation is one connected whole; it is like a pyramid pointed
at the top, which was its beginning, and exceedingly broad in its basis, which is
its fullest development in all its multitudinous component parts. Throughout the whole
are perceptible two opposites, with a reconciling medium. Thus, in the macrocosm,
“the ethereal fire is above, the water below, and the air is between these hostile
elements to reconcile them.” (Chapter vi, <i>Mishna</i> i.) The same is the case in the heaven, earth and the atmosphere, as well as in the
microcosm. But all the opposites in the cosmic, telluric and organic spheres, as well
as in the moral world, are designed to balance each other. “God has placed in all
things one to oppose the other; good to oppose evil, good proceeding from good, and
evil from evil; good purifies evil, and evil purifies good; good is in store for the
good, and evil is reserved for the evil.” (Chapter vi, <i>Mishna</i> ii.)
</p>
<p>From this analysis of its contents it will be seen that <i>the Book Jetzira</i>, which the Kabbalists claim as their oldest document, has really nothing in common
with the cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah. There is not a single word in it bearing
on <i>the En Soph</i>, the Archetypal Man, the speculations about the being and nature of the Deity, and
<i>the Sephiroth</i>, which constitute the essence of the Kabbalah. Even its treatment of the ten digits,
as part of the thirty-two ways of wisdom whereby God created the universe, which has
undoubtedly suggested to the authors of the Kabbalah the idea of the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, is quite different from the mode in which the Kabbalistic <i>Sephiroth</i> are depicted, as may be seen from a most cursory comparison of the respective diagrams
which we have given to illustrate the plans of the two systems.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides the language of <i>the Book Jetzira</i> and the train of ideas therein enunciated, as the erudite Zunz rightly remarks, shew
that this treatise belongs to <i>the Geonim</i> period, <i>i.e.</i>, about the ninth century of the Christian era, when it first became known.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11919src" href="#xd31e11919">13</a> The fabrication of this pseudograph was evidently suggested by the fact that the
Talmud mentions some <i>treatises on the Creation</i>, denominated <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הלכות יצריה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר יצירה‎</span> (<i>Sanhedrim</i> 65 <i>b</i>; 67 <i>b</i>) which “R. Chanina and R. Oshaja studied every Friday, whereby they produced a calf
three years old and ate it;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11939src" href="#xd31e11939">14</a> and whereby R. Joshua ben Chananja declared he could take fruit and instantly produce
the trees which belong to them. (<i>Jerusalem Sanhedrim</i>, cap. vii. <i lang="la">ad finem</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11949src" href="#xd31e11949">15</a>) Indeed Dr. Chwolson of Petersburg has shown in his treatise “<i>on the Remnants of the ancient Babylonian Literature in Arabic translations</i>,” that the ancient Babylonians laid it down as a maxim that if a man were minutely
and carefully to observe the process of nature, he would be able to imitate nature
and produce sundry creatures. He would not only be able to create plants and metals,
but even living beings. These artificial productions the Babylonians call <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תולידאת‎</span> <i>productions</i> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבונאת‎</span> <i>formations</i>. Gutami, the author of the <i>Agricultura Nabat</i>, who lived about 1400 B.C., devoted a long chapter to the doctrine of artificial
productions. The ancient sorcerer Ankebuta declares, in his work on artificial productions,
that he created a man, and shows how he did it; but he confesses that the human being
was without language and reason, that he could not eat, but simply opened and closed
his eyes. This and many other fragments adds R—, from whose communication we quote,
show that there were many works in Babylon which <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>treated on the artificial productions of plants, metals, and living beings, and that
the <i>Book Jetzira</i>, mentioned in the Talmud, was most probably such a Babylonian document.<span id="xd31e11972"></span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11974src" href="#xd31e11974">16</a>
</p>
<p>As the document on creation, mentioned in the Talmud, was lost in the course of time,
the author of the Treatise which we have analysed tried to supply the loss, and hence
not only called his production by the ancient name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר יצירה‎</span> <i>the Book of Creation</i>, but ascribed it to the patriarch Abraham. The perusal, however, of a single page
of this book will convince any impartial reader that it has as little in common with
the magic work mentioned in the Talmud or with the ancient Babylonian works which
treat of human creations, as with the speculations about the being and nature of the
Deity, <i>the En Soph</i> and <i>the Sephiroth</i>, which are the essence of the Kabbalah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e11990src" href="#xd31e11990">17</a>
</p>
<p>Having shown that the <i>Book Jetzira</i>, claimed by the Kabbalists as their first and oldest code of doctrines, has no affinity
with the real tenets of the Kabbalah, we have now to examine:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>II. <i>The Book Sohar.</i>
</p>
<p>Before we enter into an examination concerning the date and authorship of this renowned
code of the Kabbalistic doctrines, it will be necessary to describe the component
parts of the <i>Sohar</i>. It seems that the proper <i>Sohar</i>, which is a commentary on the five Books of Moses, according to the division into
Sabbatic sections, was originally called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מדרש יהי אור‎</span> <i>the Midrash</i> or <i>Exposition</i>, <i>Let there be Light</i>, from the words in Gen. i, 4 ; because the real Midrash begins with the exposition of this verse. The name <i>Sohar</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זוהר‎</span>), <i>i.e.</i> <i>Light</i>, <i>Splendour</i>, was given to it afterwards, either because this document begins with the theme light,
or because the word <i>Sohar</i> frequently occurs on the first page. It is referred to by the name of the <i>Book Sohar</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר הזוהר‎</span>) in the component parts of the treatise itself. (Comp. <i>The Faithful Shepherd</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 153 <i>b</i>.) The <i>Sohar</i> is also called <i>Midrash of R. Simon b. Jochai</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מדרש של ר׳ שמעון בן יוחאי‎</span>), because this Rabbi is its reputed author.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12094src" href="#xd31e12094">18</a> Interspersed throughout the <i>Sohar</i>, either as parts of the text with special titles, or in separate columns with distinct
superscriptions, are the following dissertations, which we detail according to the
order of the pages on which they respectively commence.
</p>
<p>1. <i>Tosephta</i> and <i>Mathanithan</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתניתן‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תוספתא‎</span>), or <i>Small Additional Pieces</i> which are given in vol. i, 31 <i>b</i>; 32 <i>b</i>; 37 <i>a</i>; 54 <i>b</i>; 59 <i>a</i>; 60 <i>b</i>; 62; 98 <i>b</i>; 121 <i>a</i>; 122<span class="corr" id="xd31e12148" title="Source: ,">;</span> 128 <i>b</i>; 147; 151 <i>a</i>; 152 <i>a</i>; 232<span class="corr" id="xd31e12158" title="Source: ,">;</span> 233 <i>b</i>; 234 <i>a</i>; vol. ii, 4, 27 <i>b</i>; <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>28 <i>a</i>; 68 <i>b</i>; 135 <i>b</i>; vol. iii, 29 <i>b</i>; 30 <i>a</i>; 54 <i>b</i>; 55. They briefly discuss, by way of supplement, the various topics of the Kabbalah,
such as the <i>Sephiroth</i>, the emanation of the primordial light, &amp;c., &amp;c., and address themselves in apostrophes
to the initiated in these mysteries, calling their attention to some doctrine or explanation.
</p>
<p>2. <i>Hechaloth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכלות‎</span>) or <i>The Mansions and Abodes</i> forming part of the text, vol. i, 38 <i>a</i>–45 <i>b</i>; vol. ii, 245 <i>a</i>–269 <i>a</i>. This portion of the <i>Sohar</i> describes the topographical structure of Paradise and Hell. The mansions or palaces,
which are seven in number, were at first the habitation of the earthly Adam, but,
after the fall of the protoplasts, were rearranged to be the abode of the beatified
saints, who for this reason have the enjoyment both of this world and the world to
come. The seven words in Gen. i, 2 are explained to describe these seven mansions. <i>Sohar</i>, i, 45 <i>a</i>, describes the seven Hells. In some Codices, however, this description of the Infernal
Regions is given vol. ii, 202 <i>b</i>.
</p>
<p>3. <i>Sithre Tora</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סתרי תורה‎</span>), or <i>The Mysteries of the Pentateuch</i>, given in separate columns, and at the bottom of pages as follows. Vol. i, 74 <i>b</i>; 75 <i>a</i>; 76 <i>b</i>–77 <i>a</i>; 78 <i>a</i>–81 <i>b</i>; 97 <i>a</i>–102 <i>a</i>; 107 <i>b</i>–111 <i>a</i>; 146 <i>b</i>–149 <i>b</i>; 151 <i>a</i>; 152 <i>b</i>; 154 <i>b</i>–157 <i>b</i>; 161 <i>b</i>–162 <i>b</i>; 165; vol. ii, 146 <i>a</i>. It discusses the divers topics of the Kabbalah, such as the evolution of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, the emanation of the primordial light, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>
<p>4. <i>Midrash Ha-Neelam</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מדרש הנעלם‎</span>), or <i>The Hidden Midrash</i>, occupies parallel columns with the text in vol. i, 97 <i>a</i>–140 <i>a</i>, and endeavours more to explain passages of Scripture mystically, by way of <i>Remasim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רמזים‎</span>) and <i>Gematrias</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמטריאות‎</span>), and allegorically, than to propound the doctrines of the Kabbalah. Thus Abraham’s
prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah is explained as an intercession by the congregated souls
of the saints in behalf of the sinners about to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>punished. (<i>Sohar</i>, i, 104 <i>b</i>.) Lot’s two daughters are the two proclivities in man, good and evil. (<i>Ibid.</i> 110.) Besides this mystical interpretation wherein the Kabbalistic rules of exegesis
are largely applied, the distinguishing feature of this portion of the <i>Sohar</i> is its discussion on the properties and destiny of the soul, which constitute an
essential doctrine of the Kabbalah.
</p>
<p>5. <i>Raja Mehemna</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רעיא מהמנא‎</span>), or the <i>Faithful Shepherd</i>. This portion of the <i>Sohar</i> is given in the second and third volumes, in parallel columns with the text; and
when it is too disproportioned for columns, is given at the bottom or in separate
pages, as follows. Vol. ii, 25, 40, 59 <i>b</i>; 91 <i>b</i>–93 <i>a</i>; 134 <i>b</i>, 157 <i>b</i>–159 <i>a</i>; 187 <i>b</i>–188 <i>a</i>; vol. iii, 3 <i>a</i>–4 <i>b</i>; 20 <i>a</i>, 24 <i>b</i>, 27, 28 <i>a</i>–29 <i>a</i>; 33 <i>a</i>–34 <i>a</i>; 42 <i>a</i>, 44 <i>a</i>; 63; 67 <i>b</i>–68 <i>a</i>; 81 <i>b</i>–83 <i>b</i>; 85 <i>b</i>–86 <i>a</i>; 88 <i>b</i>–90 <i>a</i>; 92 <i>b</i>–93 <i>a</i>; 97 <i>a</i>–101 <i>a</i>; 103 <i>b</i>–104 <i>a</i>; 108 <i>b</i>–111 <i>b</i>; 121 <i>b</i>–126 <i>a</i>; 145 <i>a</i>–146 <i>b</i>; 152 <i>b</i>–153 <i>b</i>; 174 <i>a</i>–175 <i>a</i>; 178 <i>b</i>–179 <i>b</i>; 180 <i>a</i>, 215 <i>a</i>–239 <i>a</i>; 242 <i>a</i>–258 <i>a</i>; 263 <i>a</i>–264 <i>a</i>; 270 <i>b</i>–283 <i>a</i>. It derives its name from the fact that it records the discussions which Moses the
Faithful Shepherd held in conference with the prophet Elias, and with R. Simon b.
Jochai, the celebrated master of the Kabbalistic school, who is called <i>the Sacred Light</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בוצינא קדישא‎</span>). The chief object of this portion is to show the profound and allegorical import
of the Mosaic commandments and prohibitions, as well as of the Rabbinic injunctions
and religious practices which obtained in the course of time. At the dialogue which
Moses the lawgiver holds with R. Simon b. Jochai the Kabbalistic lawgiver, not only
is the prophet Elias present, but Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, David, Solomon, and
God himself make their appearance; the disciples of R. Simon are frequently in ecstacies
when they hold converse with these illustrious patriarchs and kings of bygone days.

<p>6. <i>Raze Derazin</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רזי דרזין‎</span>), or <i>the Secret of Secrets, <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>Original Secrets</i>, is given in vol. ii, 70 <i>a</i>–75 <i>a</i>, and is especially devoted to the physiognomy of the Kabbalah, and the connection
of the soul with the body, based upon the advice of Jethro to his son-in-law Moses
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ואתה תחזה‎</span>) <i>and thou shalt look into the face</i>. ( Exod. xviii, 21 .)
</p>
<p>7. <i>Saba Demishpatim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סבא דמשפטים‎</span>), or <i>the Discourse of the Aged in Mishpatim</i>, given in vol. ii, 94 <i>a</i>–114 <i>a</i>. The Aged is the prophet Elias, who holds converse with R. Simon b. Jochai about
the doctrine of metempsychosis, and the discussion is attached to the Sabbatic section
called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משפטים‎</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, Exod. xxi, 1 – xxiv, 18 , because the Kabbalah takes this word to signify <i>punishments of souls</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דינין‎</span>), and finds its psychology in this section. So enraptured were the disciples when
their master, the Sacred Light, discoursed with Moses on this subject, that they knew
not whether it was day or night, or whether they were in the body or out of the body.
(<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 105 <i>b</i>.)
</p>
<p>8. <i>Siphra Detzniutha</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספרא דצניעותא‎</span>), or <i>the Book of Secrets</i> or <i>Mysteries</i>, given in vol. ii, 176 <i>b</i>–178 <i>b</i>. It is divided into five sections (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרקים‎</span>), and is chiefly occupied with discussing the questions involved in the creation,
<i>e. gr.</i> the transition from the infinite to the finite, from absolute unity to multifariousness,
from pure intelligence to matter, the double principle of masculine and feminine (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבא ואמא‎</span>), expressed in the Tetragrammaton, the androgynous protoplast, the Demonology concealed
in the letters of Scripture, as seen in Gen. vi, 2 ; Josh. ii, 1 ; 1 Kings, viii, 3 , 16 ; the mysteries contained in Isa. i, 4 , and the doctrine of the <i>Sephiroth</i> concealed in Gen. i ; &amp;c., as well as with showing the import of the letters <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהו״ה‎</span> composing the Tetragrammaton which were the principal agents in the creation. This
portion of the <i>Sohar</i> has been translated into Latin by Rosenroth in the second volume of his <i lang="la">Kabbala Denudata</i>, Frankfort-on-the-Maine, 1684.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>9. <i>Idra Rabba</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא רבא‎</span>), or <i>the Great Assembly</i> is given in vol. iii, 127 <i>b</i>–145 <i>a</i>, and derives its name from the fact that it purports to give the discourses which
R. Simon b. Jochai delivered to his disciples who congregated around him in large
numbers. Upon the summons of the Sacred Light, his disciples assembled to listen to
the secrets and enigmas contained in the <i>Book of Mysteries</i>. Hence it is chiefly occupied with a description of the form and various members
of the Deity, a disquisition on the relation of the Deity, in his two aspects of the
<i>Aged</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עתיק‎</span>) and the <i>Young</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זעיר‎</span>), to the creation and the universe, as well as on the diverse gigantic members of
the Deity, such as the head, the beard, the eyes, the nose, &amp;c., &amp;c.; a dissertation
on pneumatology, demonology, &amp;c., &amp;c. It concludes with telling us that three of the
disciples died during these discussions. This portion too is given in a Latin translation
in the second volume of Rosenroth’s <i lang="la">Kabbala Denudata</i>.
</p>
<p>10. <i>Januka</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ינוקא‎</span>), or <i>the Discourse of the Young Man</i>, is given in vol. iii, 186 <i>a</i>–192 <i>a</i>, and forms part of the text of the <i>Sohar</i> on the Sabbatic section called <i>Balak</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Numb. xxii, 2 – xxv, 9 . It derives its name from the fact that the discourses therein recorded were delivered
by a young man, under the following circumstances:—R. Isaac and R. Jehudah, two of
R. Simon b. Jochai’s disciples, when on a journey, and passing through the village
where the widow of R. Hamnuna Saba resided, visited this venerable woman. She asked
her son, the <i>young hero</i> of this discourse, who had just returned from school, to go to these two Rabbins
to receive their benediction; but the youth would not approach them because he recognised,
from the smell of their garments, that they had omitted reciting on that day the prescribed
declaration about the unity of the Deity (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמע‎</span>). When at meals this wonderful <i>Januka</i> gave them sundry discourses on the mysterious import of the washing of hands, based
on <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>Exod. xxx, 20 , on the grace recited at meals, on the <i>Shechinah</i>, on the angel who redeemed Jacob ( Gen. xlviii, 16 ), &amp;c., &amp;c., which elicited the declaration from the Rabbins that “this youth is not
the child of human parents” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האי ינוקא לאו ב״נ הוא‎</span>); and when hearing all this, R. Simon b. Jochai coincided in the opinion, that “this
youth is of superhuman origin.”
</p>
<p>11. <i>Idra Suta</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא זוטא‎</span>) or <i>the Small Assembly</i>, is given in vol. iii, 287 <i>b</i>–296 <i>b</i>, and derives its name from the fact that many of the disciples of R. Simon b. Jochai
had died during the course of these Kabbalistic revelations, and that this portion
of the <i>Sohar</i> contains the discourses which the Sacred Light delivered before his death to the
small assembly of six pupils, who still survived and congregated to listen to the
profound mysteries. It is to a great extent a recapitulation of the <i>Idra Rabba</i>, occupying itself with speculations about the <i>Sephiroth</i>, the Deity in his three aspects (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלת רישין‎</span>), or principles which successively developed themselves from each other, viz.—the
<i>En Soph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>), or the Boundless in his absolute nature, the <i>Macroprosopon</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אריך אנפין‎</span>), or the Boundless as manifested in the first emanation, and the <i>Microprosopon</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זעיר אנפין‎</span>), the other nine emanations; the abortive creations, &amp;c., and concludes with recording
the death of Simon b. Jochai, the Sacred Light and the medium through whom God revealed
the contents of the <i>Sohar</i>. The <i>Idra Suta</i> has been translated into Latin by Rosenroth in the second volume of his <i lang="la">Kabbala Denudata</i>.
</p>
<p>From this brief analysis of its component parts and contents, it will be seen that
the <i>Sohar</i> does not propound a regular Kabbalistic system, but promiscuously and reiteratedly
dilates upon the diverse doctrines of this theosophy, as indicated in the forms and
ornaments of the Hebrew alphabet, in the vowel points and accents, in the Divine names
and the letters of which they are composed, in the narratives of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>Bible, and in the traditional and national stories. Hence the <i>Sohar</i> is more a collection of homilies or rhapsodies on Kabbalistic subjects than treatises
on the Kabbalah. It is for this very reason that it became the treasury of the Kabbalah
to the followers of this theosophy. Its diversity became its charm. The long conversations
between its reputed author, R. Simon b. Jochai, and Moses, the great lawgiver and
true shepherd, which it records; the short and pathetic prayers inserted therein;
the religious anecdotes; the attractive spiritual explanations of scripture passages,
appealing to the hearts and wants of men; the description of the Deity and of the
<i>Sephiroth</i> under tender forms of human relationships, comprehensible to the finite, mind, such
as father, mother, primeval man, matron, bride, white head, the great and small face,
the luminous mirror, the higher heaven, the higher earth, &amp;c, which it gives on every
page, made the <i>Sohar</i> a welcome text-book for the students of the Kabbalah, who, by its vivid descriptions
of divine love, could lose themselves in rapturous embraces with the Deity.
</p>
<p>Now, the <i>Sohar</i> pretends to be a revelation from God, communicated through R. Simon b. Jochai, who
flourished about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 70–110, to his select disciples. We are told that “when they assembled to compose
the <i>Sohar</i>, permission was granted to the prophet Elias, to all the members of the celestial
college, to all angels, spirits, and superior souls, to assist them; and the ten spiritual
substances [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Sephiroth</i>] were charged to disclose to them their profound mysteries, which were reserved for
the days of the Messiah.” On the approach of death, R. Simon b. Jochai assembled the
small number of his disciples and friends, amongst whom was his son, R. Eleazar, to
communicate to them his last doctrines,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12697src" href="#xd31e12697">19</a> “when <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>he ordered as follows—R. Aba shall write, R. Eleazar, my son, propound, and let my
other associates quietly think about it.” (<i>Idra Suta</i>, <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 287 <i>b</i>.) It is upon the strength of these declarations, as well as upon the repeated representation
of R. Simon b. Jochai as speaking and teaching throughout this production, that the
<i>Sohar</i> is ascribed to this Rabbi on its very title-page, and that not only Jews, for centuries,
but such distinguished Christian scholars as Lightfoot, Gill, Bartolocci, Pfeifer,
Knorr von Rosenroth, Molitor, &amp;c., have maintained this opinion. A careful examination,
however, of the following internal and external evidence will show that this Thesaurus
of the Kabbalah is the production of the thirteenth century.
</p>
<p>1. The <i>Sohar</i> most fulsomely praises its own author, calls him the <i>Sacred Light</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בוצניא קדישא‎</span>), and exalts him above Moses, “the true Shepherd.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12720src" href="#xd31e12720">20</a> “I testify by the sacred heavens and the sacred earth,” declares R. Simon b. Jochai,
“that I now see what no son of man has seen since Moses ascended the second time on
Mount Sinai, for I see my face shining as brilliantly as the light of the sun when
it descends as a healing for the world; as it is written, ‘to you who fear my name
shall shine the Sun of Righteousness with a healing in his wings.’ (Malachi, [ iii, 20 ] iv, 2 .) Yea, more, I know that my face is shining, but Moses did not know it nor understand
it; for it is written ( Exod. xxxiv, 29 ), ‘Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone.’ ” (<i>Sohar</i>, iii, 132 <i>b</i>; 144 <i>a</i>.) The disciples deify R. Simon in the <i>Sohar</i>, declaring that the verse, “all thy males shall appear before the Lord God” ( Exod. xxiii, 17 ), refers to R. Simon b. Jochai, <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>who is the Lord, and before whom all men must appear. (<i>Sohar</i>, ii, 38 <i>a</i>.)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12752src" href="#xd31e12752">21</a>
</p>
<p>2. The <i>Sohar</i> quotes and mystically explains the Hebrew vowel points (i, 16 <i>b</i>; 24 <i>b</i>; ii, 116 <i>a</i>; iii, 65 <i>a</i>), which were introduced for the first time by R. Mocha of Palestine, <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 570, to facilitate the reading of the Scriptures for his students.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12772src" href="#xd31e12772">22</a>
</p>
<p>3. The <i>Sohar</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רעיא מהימנה‎</span> <i>Faithful Shepherd</i>, on section <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קדושים‎</span> iii, 82 <i>b</i>), has literally borrowed two verses from the celebrated Hymn of Ibn Gebirol, who
was born about <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1021 and died in 1070. This Hymn which is entitled <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר מלכות‎</span> <i>the Royal Diadem</i>, is a beautiful and pathetic composition, embodying the cosmic views of Aristotle,
and forms part of the Jewish service for the evening preceding the Great Day of Atonement
to the present day. The quotation in the <i>Sohar</i> from this Hymn is beyond the shadow of a doubt, as will be seen from the following
comparison—

</div><p>
</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that, though the <i>Sohar</i> is written in Aramaic, yet this quotation is in Hebrew, and in the <i>rhyme</i> of Ibn Gebirol.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12840src" href="#xd31e12840">23</a>
</p>
<p>4. The <i>Sohar</i> (i, 18 <i>b</i>; 23 <i>a</i>) quotes and explains the interchange, on the outside of the <i>Mezuza</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12856src" href="#xd31e12856">24</a> of the words <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה אלהינו יהוה‎</span>) <i>Jehovah our God is Jehovah</i> for (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כוזו במוכסז כוזו‎</span>) <i lang="xx">Kuzu Bemuchzaz Kuzu</i>, by substituting for each letter its immediate predecessor in the alphabet, which
was transplanted from France into Spain in the thirteenth century.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12884src" href="#xd31e12884">25</a>
</p>
<p>5. The <i>Sohar</i> (iii, 232 <i>b</i>) uses the expression <i>Esnoga</i>, which is a Portuguese corruption of synagogue, and explains it in a Kabbalistic
manner as a compound of two Hebrew words, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Es</i> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אש‎</span> and <i>Noga</i> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוגה‎</span> <i>brilliant light</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12913src" href="#xd31e12913">26</a>
</p>
<p>6. The <i>Sohar</i> (ii, 32 <i>a</i>) mentions the Crusades, the momentary taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders from the
Infidels, and the retaking of it by the Saracens.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12923src" href="#xd31e12923">27</a> “Woe to the time,” it says, “wherein Ishmael saw the world, and received the sign
of circumcision! What did the Holy One, blessed be his name? He excluded the descendants
of Ishmael, <i>i.e.</i>, the Mahommedans, from the congregation in heaven, but gave them a portion on earth
in the Holy Land, because of the sign of the covenant which they possess. The Mahommedans
are, therefore, destined to rule for a time over the Holy Land; and they will prevent
the Israelites from returning to it, till the merit of the Mahommedans is accomplished.
At that time the descendants of Ishmael will be the occasion of terrible wars in the
world, and the children of Edom, <i>i.e.</i>, the Christians, will gather together against them and do battle with them, some
at sea and some on land, and some in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and the victory
will now <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>be on the one side and then on the other, but the Holy Land will not remain in the
hands of the Christians.”
</p>
<p>7. The <i>Sohar</i> records events which transpired <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1264. Thus on Numb. xxiv, 17 , which the <i>Sohar</i> explains as referring to the time preceding the advent of Messiah, it remarks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12947src" href="#xd31e12947">28</a> “the Holy One, blessed be he, is prepared to rebuild Jerusalem. Previous to the rebuilding
thereof he will cause to appear, a wonderful and splendid star, which will shine seventy
days. It will first be seen on Friday, Elul = July 25th, and disappear on Saturday
or Friday evening at the end of seventy days. On the day preceding [its disappearance,
<i>i.e.</i> October 2nd] when it will still be seen in the city of Rome, on that self-same day
three high walls of that city of Rome and the great palace will fall, and the pontiff
ruler of the city will die.” (<i>Sohar</i> iii, 212 <i>b</i>.) Now the comet here spoken of appeared in Rome, July 25th, 1264, and was visible
till October 2nd, which are literally the seventy days mentioned in the <i>Sohar</i>. Moreover, July 25th, when the comet first appeared, actually happened on a Friday;
on the day of its disappearance, October 2nd, the sovereign pontiff of Rome, Urban
IV, died at Perugia, when it was believed that the appearance of the comet was the
omen of his death, and the great and strong palace (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכלא רברבא‎</span>) Vincimento, fell on the self-same day, October 2nd, into the hands of the insurrectionists.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12963src" href="#xd31e12963">29</a>
</p>
<p>8. The <i>Sohar</i>, in assigning a reason why its contents were not revealed before, says that the “time
in which R. Simon ben Jochai lived was peculiarly worthy and glorious, and that it
is near the advent of the Messiah,” for which cause this <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>revelation was reserved till the days of R. Simon, to be communicated through him.
Yet, speaking elsewhere of the advent of the Messiah, the <i>Sohar</i>, instead of placing it in the second century when this Rabbi lived, forgets itself
and says<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e12977src" href="#xd31e12977">30</a>—“When the sixtieth or the sixty-sixth year shall have passed over the threshold of
the sixth millenium [<span class="asc">A.M.</span> 5060–66 = <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1300–1306] the Messiah will appear” (<i>Sohar</i> i, 116 <i>a</i>, 117 <i>b</i>, Comp. also iii, 252 <i>a</i>); thus showing that the author lived in the thirteenth century of the Christian era.
In perfect harmony with this is the fact that:—
</p>
<p>9. The doctrine of the <i>En Soph</i>, and the <i>Sephiroth</i>, as well as the metempsychosisian retribution were not known before the thirteenth
century.
</p>
<p>10. The very existence of the <i>Sohar</i>, according to the confession of the staunch Kabbalist, Jehudah Chajoth (flourished
1500), was unknown to such distinguished Kabbalists as Nachmanides (1195–1270) and
Ben-Adereth (1235–1310); the first who mentions it is Todros Abulafia (1234–1306).
</p>
<p>11. Isaac of Akko (flourished 1290) fully confirms all that we have hitherto adduced
from the import of this book, by his testimony that “the <i>Sohar</i> was put into the world from the head of a Spaniard.” To the same effect is the testimony
of Joseph Ibn Wakkar, who in speaking of later books which may be relied upon, recommends
only those of Moses Nachmanides and Todros Abulafia; “but,” he adds, “the <i>Sohar</i> is full of errors, and one must take care not to be misled by them.” Upon which,
the erudite Steinschneider rightly remarks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13012src" href="#xd31e13012">31</a> “this is an impartial and indirect testimony that the <i>Sohar</i> was recognised scarcely fifty years after its <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>appearing as one of the later works, and was not attributed to Simon ben Jochai.”
</p>
<p>12. That Moses de Leon, who first published and sold the <i>Sohar</i>, as the production of R. Simon b. Jochai, was himself the author of it, was admitted
by his own wife and daughter, as will be seen from the following account in the <i>Book Juchassin</i>, (p.p. 88, 89, 95, ed. Filipowski, London, 1857), which we give in an abridged form.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13033src" href="#xd31e13033">32</a> When Isaac of Akko, who escaped the massacre after the capture of this city (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1291), came to Spain and there saw the <i>Sohar</i>, he was anxious to ascertain whether it was genuine, since it pretended to be a Palestine
production, and he, though born and brought up in the Holy Land, in constant intercourse
with the disciples of the celebrated Kabbalist, Nachmanides, had never heard a syllable
about this marvellous work. Now, Moses de Leon, whom he met in Valladolid, declared
to him on a most solemn oath that he had at Avila an ancient exemplar, which was the
very autograph of R. Simon ben Jochai, and offered to submit it to him to be tested.
In the meantime, however, Moses de Leon was taken ill on his journey home, and died
at Arevolo, <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1305. But two <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>distinguished men of Avila, David Rafen and Joseph de Avila, who were determined to
sift the matter, ascertained the falsehood of this story from the widow and daughter
of Moses de Leon. Being a rich man and knowing that Moses de Leon left his family
without means, Joseph de Avila promised, that if she would give him the original MS.
of the <i>Sohar</i> from which her husband made the copies, his son should marry her daughter, and that
he would give them a handsome dowry. Whereupon the widow and daughter declared, that
they did not possess any such MS., that Moses de Leon never had it, but that he composed
the <i>Sohar</i> from his own head, and wrote it with his own hand. Moreover, the widow candidly confessed
that she had frequently asked her husband why he published the production of his own
intellect under another man’s name, and that he told her that if he were to publish
it under his own name nobody would buy it, whereas under the name of R. Simon b. Jochai
it yielded him a large revenue. This account is confirmed in a most remarkable manner
by the fact that—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>13. The <i>Sohar</i> contains whole passages which Moses de Leon translated into Aramaic, from his other
works, as the learned Jellinek has demonstratively proved. To transfer these passages
here would occupy too much of our space. We must, therefore, refer the reader to the
monograph itself,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13059src" href="#xd31e13059">33</a> and shall only give one example, which the erudite historian, Dr. Graetz,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13064src" href="#xd31e13064">34</a> has pointed out. In his <i>Sephar Ha-Rimon</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר הרימון‎</span>), which he composed <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1827, and which is a Kabbalistic explanation of the Mosaic precepts, Moses de Leon
endeavours to account for the non-occurrence of the Tetragrammaton in the history
of the hexahemeron, whilst it does occur immediately afterwards, by submitting that
as the earthly world is finite and perishable, this divine name, which denotes eternity,
could not be used at the creation thereof; for if it had been created under its influence,
the world would have been as imperishable as this name. In corroboration of this,
Moses de Leon quotes the passage (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לכו חזו מפעלות אלהים אשר שם שמות בארץ‎</span>) <i>Come, behold the works of Elohim, what perishableness he made in the earth</i> ( Ps. xlvi, 8 ), showing that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמות‎</span> <i>destruction</i>, <i>perishableness</i>, is consonant with the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים‎</span>. In looking at the original, it will be seen that the text has <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span> and not <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהים‎</span>, and that Moses de Leon, by a slip of memory, confounded this passage with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לכו וראו מפעלות אלהים‎</span> <i>Come and see the works of Elohim</i> ( Ps. xlvi, 5 ). Now, the whole explanation and the <i>same blunder</i> are transferred into the <i>Sohar</i>. The commentators on this treasury of the Kabbalah, not knowing the cause of this
blunder, express their great surprise that the <i>Sohar</i> should explain a mis-quotation. We subjoin the two passages in parallel columns.

<p>It is for these and many other reasons that the <i>Sohar</i> is now regarded by Steinschneider, Beer, Jellinek, Graetz, &amp;c., as a pseudograph
of the thirteenth century. That Moses de Leon should have palmed the <i>Sohar</i> upon Simon b. Jochai was nothing remarkable, since this Rabbi is regarded by tradition
as the embodiment of mysticism. No better hero could be selected for the <i>Sohar</i> than R. Simon, of whom the Talmud gives us the following account: “Once upon a time,
R. Jehudah, R. Jose, and R. Simon sat together, and R. Jehudah b. Gerim sat by them.
R. Jehudah then began and said—How beautiful are the works of this nation (<i>i.e.</i>, the Romans)! they have erected market-places, they have erected bridges, and they
have erected baths! R. Jose was quiet, but R. Simon b. Jochai answered and said: what
they have built they have built for no one except for their own use, they made markets
to allure prostitutes, they made baths to gratify themselves therein, and bridges
to get tolls by them. Jehudah b. Gerim repeated this, and the emperor’s government
got to hear it, who passed the following decree: Jehudah, who exalted, is to be exalted;
Jose, who was silent, is to be banished to Zipporis; and Simon, who spoke evil, is
to be killed. He (<i>i.e.</i>, R. Simon) at once concealed himself with his son, in the place of study, whither
his wife daily brought them a loaf and a flask of water; but as the rigour of the
decree increased, he said to his son: women are weak-minded—if she is tortured she
may betray us. Hence, they left, and betook themselves into a deep cavern, where by
a miracle <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>a crab-tree and a well were created for their subsistence. He and his son sat in the
sand up to their necks all the day studying the Law. They spent twelve long years
in this cavern; when Elias the prophet came and stood at the entrance of the cavern,
and called out—Who will inform the son of Jochai that the emperor is dead, and that
the decree is commuted? They came out and saw the people tilling and sowing.” (<i>Sabbath</i>, 33 <i>a</i>. Comp. also, <i>Jerusalem Shebiith</i>, ix, 1; <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, cap. lxxix; <i>Midrash Koheleth</i>, x, 8; <i>Midrash Esther</i>, i, 9.) This is the secret why the story that R. Simon b. Jochai composed the <i>Sohar</i> during his twelve years’ residence in the cavern obtained credence among the followers
of the Kabbalah.
</p>
<p>III. <i>The Commentary on the Ten Sephiroth.</i>
</p>
<p>It is this commentary to which we must look, as the most ancient document embodying
the doctrines of the Kabbalah. The author of this commentary, R. Azariel b. Menachem,
was born in Valladolid, about 1160. He distinguished himself as a philosopher, Kabbalist,
Talmudist, and commentator, as his works indicate; he was a pupil of Isaac the Blind,
who is regarded as the originator of the Kabbalah, and master of the celebrated R.
Moses Nachmanides, who is also a distinguished pillar of Kabbalism. R. Azariel died
<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1238, at the advanced age of seventy-eight years. “The Commentary on the Ten <i>Sephiroth</i>” is in questions and answers,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13189src" href="#xd31e13189">35</a> and the following is the lucid analysis of it as given by the erudite Jellinek, according
to Spinoza’s form of Ethics.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Definition.</span>—By the Being who is the cause and governor of all things, I understand the <i>En Soph</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a Being infinite, boundless, absolutely identical with itself, united in itself,
without attributes, will, intention, desire, thought, word or deed. (Answers 2 and
4.)
</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Definition.</span>—By <i>Sephiroth</i> I understand the potencies which emanated from the absolute <i>En Soph</i>, all entities limited by quantity, which like the will, without changing its nature,
wills diverse objects that are the possibilities of multifarious things. (Answers
3 and 9.)
</p>
<p>i. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—The primary cause and governor of the world is the <i>En Soph</i>, who is both immanent and transcendent. (Answer 1.)
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="sc">Proof.</span>—Each effect has a cause, and every thing which has order and design has a governor.
(Answer 1.)
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="sc">Proof.</span>—Every thing visible has a limit, what is limited is finite, what is finite is not
absolutely identical; the primary cause of the world is invisible, therefore unlimited,
infinite, absolutely identical, <i>i.e.</i>, he is the <i>En Soph</i>. (Answer 2.)
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="sc">Proof.</span>—As the primary cause of the world is infinite, nothing can exist <i>without</i> (<span class="asc">EXTRA</span>) him; hence he is immanent. (<i>Ibid.</i>)
</p>
<p><i>Scholion.</i>—As the <i>En Soph</i> is invisible and exalted, it is the root of both faith and unbelief. (<i>Ibid.</i>)
</p>
<p>ii. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—The <i>Sephiroth</i> are the medium between the absolute <i>En Soph</i> and the real world.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Proof.</span>—As the real world is limited and not perfect, it cannot directly proceed from the
<i>En Soph</i>, still the <i>En Soph</i> must exercise his influence over it, or his perfection would cease. Hence the <i>Sephiroth</i>, which, in their intimate connection with the <i>En Soph</i>, are perfect, and in their severance are imperfect, must be the medium. (Answer 3.)
</p>
<p><i>Scholion.</i>—Since all existing things originated by means of <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>the <i>Sephiroth</i>, there are a higher, a middle, and a lower degree of the real world. (<i lang="la">Vide infra</i>, Proposition 6.)
</p>
<p>iii. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—There are ten intermediate <i>Sephiroth</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Proof.</span>—All bodies have three dimensions, each of which repeats the other (3 × 3); and by
adding thereunto space generally, we obtain the <i>number ten</i>. As the <i>Sephiroth</i> are the potencies of all that is limited they must be <i>ten</i>. (Answer 4).
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Scholion.</i>—The number ten does not contradict the absolute unity of the <i>En Soph</i>, as <i>one</i> is the basis of all numbers, plurality proceeds from unity, the germs contain the
development, just as fire, flame, sparks and colour have <i>one</i> basis, though they differ from one another. (Answer 6.)
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Scholion.</i>—Just as cogitation or thought, and even the mind as a cogitated object, is limited,
becomes concrete and has a measure, although <i>pure thought</i> proceeds from the <i>En Soph</i>; so limit, measure, and concretion are the attributes of the <i>Sephiroth</i>. (Answer 7.)
</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—The <i>Sephiroth</i> are emanations and not creations.
</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Proof.</span>—As the absolute <i>En Soph</i> is perfect, the <i>Sephiroth</i> proceeding therefrom must also be perfect; hence they are not created. (Answer 5.)
</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Proof.</span>—All created objects diminish by abstraction; the <i>Sephiroth</i> do not lessen, as their activity never ceases; hence they cannot be created. (<i>Ibid.</i>)
</p>
<p><i>Scholion.</i>—The first <i>Sephira</i> was in the <i>En Soph</i> as a power before it became a reality; then the second <i>Sephira</i> emanated as a potency for the intellectual world, and afterwards the other <i>Sephiroth</i> emanated for the sensuous and material world. This, however, does not imply a <i>prius</i> and <i>posterius</i> or a gradation in the <i>En Soph</i>, but just as a light whose kindled lights which shine sooner and later and variously,
so it embraces all in a unity. (Answer 8.)
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>5. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—The <i>Sephiroth</i> are both active and passive (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מקביל ומתקבל‎</span>).
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Proof.</span>—As the <i>Sephiroth</i> do not set aside the unity of the <i>En Soph</i>, each one of them must receive from its predecessor, and impart to its successor—<i>i.e.</i>, be receptive and imparting. (Answer 9.)
</p>
<p>6. <span class="sc">Proposition.</span>—The first <i>Sephira</i> is called <i>Inscrutable Height</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רום מעלה‎</span>); the second, <i>Wisdom</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמה‎</span>); the third, <i>Intelligence</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בינה‎</span>); the fourth, <i>Love</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסד‎</span>); the fifth, <i>Justice</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פחד‎</span>); the sixth, <i>Beauty</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפארת‎</span>); the seventh, <i>Firmness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נצח‎</span>); the eighth, <i>Splendour</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוד‎</span>); the ninth, <i>the Righteous is the Foundation of the World</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדיק יסוד עולם‎</span>); and the tenth, <i>Righteousness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדק‎</span>).
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Scholion.</i>—The first three <i>Sephiroth</i> form the world of thought; the second three the world of soul; and the four last
the world of body—thus corresponding to the intellectual, moral, and material worlds.
(Answer 10.)
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Scholion.</i>—The first <i>Sephira</i> stands in relation to the soul, inasmuch as it is called a <i>unity</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יחידה‎</span>); the second, inasmuch as it is denominated <i>living</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חיה‎</span>); the third, inasmuch as it is termed <i>spirit</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח‎</span>); the fourth, inasmuch as it is called <i>vital principle</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גפש‎</span>); the fifth, inasmuch as it is denominated <i>soul</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשמה‎</span>); the sixth operates on the blood, the seventh on the bones, the eighth on the veins,
the ninth on the flesh, and the tenth on the skin. (<i>Ibid.</i>)
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Scholion.</i>—The first <i>Sephira</i> is like the concealed light, the second like sky-blue, the third like yellow, the
fourth like white, the fifth like red, the sixth like white-red, the seventh like
whitish-red, the eighth like reddish-white, the ninth like white-red-whitish-red-reddish-white,
and the tenth is like the light reflecting all colours.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13534src" href="#xd31e13534">36</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gradation of the <i>Sephiroth</i> is as follows—
</p>
<div class="figure p180width"><img src="images/p180.png" alt="" width="195" height="370"></div><p>
</p>
<p>For this date of the Kabbalah (<i>i.e.</i>, 1150–1190) we have the testimony of some of the earliest and most intelligent Kabbalists
themselves. Thus R. Joseph b. Abraham Gikatilla (born about 1247, and died 1307) most
distinctly tells us that R. Isaac the Blind, of Posquiers (flour. circa 1190–1210),
the teacher of R. Azariel, was the first who taught the doctrines of this theosophy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13554src" href="#xd31e13554">37</a> R. Bechja b. Asher, another Kabbalist who lived soon after this system was made known,
in his commentary on the Pentateuch, which he composed <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1291, styles R. Isaac the Blind, as <i>the Father of the Kabbalah</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13573src" href="#xd31e13573">38</a> Shem Tob b. Abraham Ibn Gaon (born 1283), another ancient Kabbalist, in attempting
to trace a Kabbalistic explanation of a passage in the Bible to its fountain head,
goes back to R. Isaac as the primary source, and connects him immediately with the
prophet Elias, who is said to have revealed the <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>mysteries of this theosophy to this corypheus of the Kabbalah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13584src" href="#xd31e13584">39</a> Whilst the author of the Kabbalistic work entitled <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מערכת אלהות‎</span> the contemporary of R. Solomon b. Abraham b. Adereth (flour. <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1260), frankly declares that “the doctrine of the <i>En Soph</i> and the <i>ten Sephiroth</i> is neither to be found in the Law, Prophets, or Hagiographa, nor in the writings
of the Rabbins of blessed memory, but rests solely upon signs which are scarcely perceptible.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13625src" href="#xd31e13625">40</a>
</p>
<p>It has indeed been supposed that covert allusions to <i>the Sephiroth</i> are to be found in the Talmud. If this could be proved, the date of the Kabbalah
would have to be altered from the twelfth to the second or third century after Christ.
An examination, however, of the passage in question, upon which this opinion is based,
will show how thoroughly fanciful it is. The passage is as follows—“The Rabbins propound,
<span class="corr" id="xd31e13639" title="Source: At">at</span> first the name of twelve letters was communicated to every one, but when the profane
multiplied, it was only communicated to the most pious of the priests, and these pre-eminently
pious priests absorbed it from their fellow priests in the chant. It is recorded that
R. Tarphon said, I once went up the orchestra in the Temple after my maternal uncle,
and, bending forward my ear to a priest, I heard how he absorbed it from his fellow
priests in the chant. R. Jehudah said in the name of Rab, the divine name of forty-two
letters is only communicated to such as are pious, not easily provoked, not given
to drinking, and are not self opinionated. He who <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>knows this name and preserves it in purity, is beloved above, cherished below, respected
by every creature, and is heir of both worlds—the world that now is, and the world
to come.” (<i>Babylon Kiddushin</i>, 71 <i>a</i>.) Upon this the celebrated Maimonides (born 1135, died <span class="corr" id="xd31e13649" title="Source: 1304">1204</span>) remarks—“Now everyone who has any intelligence knows that the forty-two letters
cannot possibly make one word, and that they must therefore have composed several
words. There is no doubt that these words conveyed certain ideas, which were designed
to bring man nearer to the true conception of the Divine essence, through the process
we have already described. These words, composed of numerous letters, have been designated
as a single name, because like all accidental proper names they indicate one single
object; and to make the object more intelligible several words are employed, as many
words are sometimes used to express one single thing. This must be well understood,
that they taught the ideas indicated by these names, and not the simple pronunciation
of the meaningless letters. Neither the divine name composed of twelve letters, nor
the one of forty-two letters, ever obtained the title of <i>Shem Ha-Mephorash</i>—this being the designation of the <i>particular name</i>, or the Tetragrammaton, as we have already propounded. As to the two former names,
they assuredly convey a certain metaphysical lesson, and there is proof that one of
them contained a lesson of this kind; for the Rabbins say in the Talmud with regard
to it: ‘The name of forty-two letters is very holy, and is only communicated to such
as are pious, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.’ Thus far the Talmud. But how remote from the meaning
of their author is the sense attached to these words! Forsooth most people believe
that it is simply by the pronunciation of the mere letters, without any idea being
attached to them, that the sublime things are to be obtained, and that it is for them
that those moral qualifications and that great preparation are requisite. But it is
evident that <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>the design of all this is to convey certain metaphysical ideas which constitute the
mysteries of the divine Law as we have already explained. It is shewn in the metaphysical
Treatises that it is impossible to forget science—I speak of the perception of <i>the active intellect</i>—and this is the meaning of the remark in the Talmud, ‘he [to whom the divine name
of forty-two letters is communicated] retains what he learns.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e13660src" href="#xd31e13660">41</a>
</p>
<p>It is this passage, as well as Maimonides’ comment upon it, which led the erudite
Franck to the conclusion that the mysteries of the Kabbalah were known to the doctors
of the Talmud, and that the forty-two letters composing the divine name are <i>the ten Sephiroth</i>, which, by supplying the <i>Vav</i> conjunctive before the last <i>Sephira</i>, consist exactly of forty-two letters, as follows:—

</p>
<p>But Franck, like many other writers, confounds mysticism with Kabbalah. That the Jews
had an extensive mysticism, embracing theosophy with its collateral angelology and
uranology, as well as christology and magic, long before the development of the Kabbalah,
and that there were a certain class of people who specially devoted themselves to
the study of this mysticism, and who styled themselves “<i>Men of Faith</i>” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בעלי אמונות‎</span>), is evident from a most cursory glance at the Jewish literature. Based upon the
remark—“The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show them his
covenant,” ( Ps. xxv, 14 ,) some of the most distinguished Jewish doctors in the days of Christ, and afterwards,
claimed an attainment of superhuman knowledge, communicated to them either by a voice
from heaven (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בת קול‎</span>) or by Elias the prophet (<i>Baba Mezia</i>, 59 <i>b</i>; <i>Sabbath</i>, 77 <i>b</i>; <i>Chagiga</i>, 3 <i>b</i>, 10 <i>a</i>; <i>Sanhedrin</i>, 48 <i>b</i>; <i>Nidda</i>, 20 <i>b</i>; <i>Joma</i>, 9 <i>b</i>). <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>The sages had also secret doctrines about the hexahemeron (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה בראשית‎</span>) and the Vision of Ezekiel = Theosophy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה מרכבה‎</span>), “which were only communicated to presidents of courts of justice and those who
were of a careful heart” (<i>Chagiga</i>, 12 <i>a</i>–16 <i>a</i>). Coeven with this are the mysteries connected with the different letters of the
several divine names (<i>Kiddushin</i>, 71 <i>a</i>). Those who were deemed worthy to be admitted into these secrets could at any moment
call into existence new creations either in the animal or vegetable kingdom (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 65 <i>b</i>, 67 <i>b</i>; <i>Jerusalem Sanhedrin</i>, vii); they could fly in the air, heal the sick, drive out evil spirits, and suspend
the laws of nature, by sundry mystical transpositions and commutations of the letters
composing the divine names, which they wrote down on slips of vellum or pieces of
paper and called “amulets” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קמיעות‎</span>). This mysticism and the literature embodying it began to develop themselves more
fully and to spread more extensively from the end of the eighth and the commencement
of the ninth centuries. Towards the close of the eighth century came into existence
</p>
<p>1. The celebrated mystical work entitled <i>the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba</i>, which alternately treats each letter of the Hebrew Alphabet as representing an idea
as an abbreviation for a word (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוטריקון‎</span>), and as the symbol of some sentiment, according to its peculiar form, in order to
attach to those letters moral, theoanthropic, angelogical and mystical notions. This
work has recently been reprinted in two recensions in Jellinek’s <i>Beth Ha-Midrash</i>, vol. iii, p. 12–64, Leipzig, 1855.
</p>
<p>2. The <i>Book of Enoch</i> which describes the glorification of Enoch and his transformation into the angel
Metatron, regarding him as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ידו״ד הקטון‎</span> <i>the Minor Deity</i>, in contradistinction to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ידו״ד הגדול‎</span> <i>the Great God</i> and which was originally a constituent part of <i>the Alphabet of R. Akiba</i>. It is reprinted in Jellinek’s <i>Beth Ha-Midrash</i>, vol. ii, pp. 114–117. Leipzig, 1853.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. <i>Shiur Koma</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיעור קומה‎</span>), or <i>the Dimensions of the Deity</i>, which claims to be a revelation from the angel Metatron to R. Ishmael, and describes
the size of the body and the sundry members of the Deity. It is given in the Book
Raziel (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר רזיאל‎</span>) of Eleazer b. Jehudah of Worms, printed at Amsterdam, 1701, and at Warsaw, 1812.
</p>
<p>4. <i>The Palaces</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכלות‎</span>). This mystical document opens with an exaltation of those who are worthy to see
the chariot throne (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צפיית המרכבה‎</span>), declaring that they know whatever happens and whatever is about to happen in the
world; that he who offends them will be severely punished; and that they are so highly
distinguished as not to be required to rise before any one except a king, a high priest,
and the Sanhedrim. It then celebrates the praises of Almighty God and his chariot
throne; describes the dangers connected with seeing this chariot throne (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מרכבה‎</span>); gives an episode from the history of the martyrs and the Roman emperor Lupinus,
a description of the angels, and of the sundry formulæ wherewith they are adjured.
Whereupon follows a description of the seven heavenly palaces, each of which is guarded
by eight angels, and into which the student of the mysterious chariot throne may transpose
himself in order to learn all mysteries, a description of the formulæ by virtue of
which these angelic guards are obliged to grant admission into the celestial palaces,
and of the peculiar qualifications of those who desire to enter into them. The document
then concludes with detailing some hymns of praise, a conversation between God, Israel,
and the angels about those mysteries, a knowledge of which makes man suddenly learned
without any trouble, and with a description of this mystery, which consists in certain
prayers and charms. This mystical production has also been reprinted in Jellinek’s
valuable <i>Beth Ha-Midrash</i>, vol. iii, pp. 83–108.
</p>
<p>These mystical treatises constitute the centre around which <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>cluster all the productions of this school, which gradually came into existence in
the course of time. So numerous became the disciples of mysticism in the twelfth century,
and so general became the belief in their power of performing miraculous cures, driving
out evil spirits, &amp;c., &amp;c., by virtue of charms consisting of the letters composing
the divers divine names transposed and commuted in mystical forms, that the celebrated
Maimonides found it necessary to denounce the system. “We have one divine name only,”
says he, “which is not derived from His attributes, viz., the Tetragrammaton, for
which reason it is called <i>Shem Ha-Mephorash</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שם המפורש‎</span>). Believe nothing else, and give no credence to the nonsense of the writers of charms
and amulets (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כותבי הקמיעות‎</span>), to what they tell you or to what you find in their foolish writings about the divine
names, which they invent without any sense, calling them appellations of the Deity
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמות‎</span>), and affirming that they require holiness and purity and perform miracles. All these
things are fables: a sensible man will not listen to them, much less believe in them.”
(<i>More Nebuchim</i>, i, 61.)
</p>
<p>But this mysticism, with its thaumaturgy, though espoused by later Kabbalists and
incorporated into their writings, is perfectly distinct from the Kabbalah in its first
and pure form, and is to be distinguished by the fact that it has no system, knows
nothing of the speculations of <i>the En Soph</i>, <i>the ten Sephiroth</i>, the doctrine of emanations, and the four worlds, which are the essential and peculiar
elements of the Kabbalah. As to Franck’s ingenious hypothesis, based upon the same
number of letters constituting a divine name, mentioned in the Talmud, and the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, we can only say that the Kabbalists themselves never claimed this far-fetched identity,
and that Ignatz Stern has shown (<i>Ben Chananja</i>, iii, p. 261), that the <i>Sohar</i> itself takes the ten divine names mentioned in the Bible, which it enumerated in
vol. iii, 11 <i>a</i>, and which <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>it makes to correspond to the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, to be the sacred name composed of forty-two letters, viz.:—

<p>Having ascertained its <i>date</i>, we now come to the <i>origin</i> of the Kabbalah. Nothing can be more evident than that the cardinal and distinctive
tenets of the Kabbalah in its original form, as stated at the beginning of the second
part of this Essay, are derived from Neo-Platonism. Any doubt upon this subject must
be relinquished when the two systems are compared. The very expression <i>En Soph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>) which the Kabbalah uses to designate the Incomprehensible One, is foreign, and is
evidently an imitation of the Greek <span class="trans" title="apeiros"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἄπειρος</span></span>. The speculations about <i>the En Soph</i>, that he is superior to actual being, thinking and knowing, are thoroughly Neo-Platonic
(<span class="trans" title="epekeina ousias, energias, nou kai noēseōs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐπέκεινα οὐσίας, ἐνεργίας, νοῦ <span class="corr" id="xd31e14080" title="Source: χαὶ">καὶ</span> νοήσεως</span></span>); and R. Azariel, whose work, as we have seen, is the first Kabbalistic production,
candidly tells us that in viewing the Deity as purely negative, and divesting him
of all attributes, he followed the opinion of the philosophers.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14092src" href="#xd31e14092">42</a> When R. Azariel moreover tells us that “the <i>En Soph</i> can neither be comprehended by the intellect, nor described in words; for there is
no letter or word which can grasp him,” we have here almost the very words of Proclus,
who tells us that, “although he is generally called the unity (<span class="trans" title="to hen"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὸ ἕν</span></span>) or the first, it would be better if no name were given him; for there is no word
which can depict his nature—he is (<span class="trans" title="arrhētos, agnōstos"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e14114" title="Source: ἀῤῥητος, αγνωστὸς">ἄῤῥητος, ἄγνωστος</span></span></span>), the inexpressible, the unknown.” (<i>Theol. Plat.</i> ii, 6.)
</p>
<p>The Kabbalah propounds that the <i>En Soph</i>, not being an object of cognition, made his existence known in the creation of the
world by <i>the Sephiroth</i>, or <i>Emanations</i>, or <i>Intelligences</i>. <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>So Neo-Platonism. The <i>Sephiroth</i> are divided in the Kabbalah into a trinity of triads respectively denominated <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם השכל‎</span> <i>the Intellectual World</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הנפש‎</span> <i>the Sensuous World</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולם הטבע‎</span> <i>the Material World</i>, which exactly corresponds to the three triads of Neo-Platonism <span class="trans" title="nous, psychē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">νοῦς, ψύχη</span></span>, and <span class="trans" title="physis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">φύσις</span></span>. The Kabbalah teaches that these <i>Sephiroth</i> are both infinite and perfect, and finite and imperfect, in so far as the source
from which they emanate imparts or withholds his fulness from them. Neo-Platonism
also teaches that “every emanation, though less perfect than that from which it emanates,
has yet a similarity with it, and, so far as this similarity goes, remains in it,
departing from it so far as it is unlike, but as far as possible being one with it
and remaining in it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14175src" href="#xd31e14175">43</a> Even the comparison between the emanation of <i>the Sephiroth</i> from <i>the En Soph</i>, and the rays proceeding from light to describe the immanency and perfect unity of
the two, is the same as the Neo-Platonic figure employed to illustrate the emanations
from one principium (<span class="trans" title="hoion ek phōtos tēn ex autou perilampsin"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e14195" title="Source: οίον">οἷον</span> ἐκ φωτὸς τὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ περίλαμψιν</span></span><span class="corr" id="xd31e14205" title="Not in source">)</span>.

notes and the Hebrew text, was published by Rittangel, Amsterdam, 1662. The Book is
also published with a German translation and notes, by John Friedrich v. Meyer, Leipzig,

<p class="first">It now remains for us to describe the development of the Kabbalah, to point out the
different schools into which its followers are divided, and to detail the literature
which this theosophy called into existence in the course of time. The limits of this
Essay demand that this should be done as briefly as possible.
</p>
<p>The great land mark in the development of the Kabbalah is the birth of <i>the Sohar</i>, which divides the history of this theosophy into two periods, viz., the pre-<i>Sohar</i> period and the post-<i>Sohar</i> period. During these two periods different schools developed themselves, which are
classified by the erudite historian, Dr. Graetz, as follows:—<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14220src" href="#xd31e14220">1</a>
</p>
<p>I.—THE SCHOOL OF GERONA, so called from the fact that the founders of it were born
in this place and established the school in it. To this school, which is the cradle
of the Kabbalah, belong
</p>
<p>1. Isaac the Blind (flour. 1190–1210), denominated the Father of the Kabbalah. His
productions have become a prey to time, and only a few fragments have survived as
quotations in other theosophic works. From these we learn that he espoused the despised
doctrine of metempsychosis as an article of creed, and that from looking into a man’s
face, he could tell whether the individual possessed a new soul from the celestial
world of spirits, or whether he had an old soul which has been migrating from body
to body and has still to accomplish its purity before its return to rest in its heavenly
home.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. Azariel and Ezra, disciples of Isaac the Blind. The former of these is the author
of the celebrated <i>Commentary on the Ten Sephiroth</i>, which is the first Kabbalistic production, and of which we have given an analysis
in the second part of this Essay (<i lang="la">vide supra</i>, p. 176). Of Ezra next to nothing is known beyond the fact that his great intimacy
with Azariel led some writers to identify the two names.
</p>
<p>3. Jehudah b. Jakar, a contemporary of the foregoing Kabbalists. No works of his have
survived, and he is only known as the teacher of the celebrated Nachmanides and from
being quoted as a Kabbalistic authority.
</p>
<p>4. Moses Nachmanides, born in Gerona about 1195, the pupil of Azariel, Ezra, and Jehudah
Ibn Jakar. It was the conversion of this remarkable and famous Talmudist to this newly-born
Kabbalah which gave to it an extraordinary importance and rapid spread amongst the
numerous followers of Nachmanides. It is related that, notwithstanding all the efforts
of his teachers, Nachmanides at first was decidedly adverse to this system; and that
one day the Kabbalist who most exerted himself to convert him was caught in a house
of ill fame and condemned to death. He requested Nachmanides to visit him on the Sabbath,
being the day fixed for his execution; and when Nachmanides reproved him for his sins,
the Kabbalist declared that he was innocent, and that he would appear at his house
on this very day, after the execution, and partake with him the Sabbath meal. He proved
true to his promise, as by means of the Kabbalistic mysteries he effected that, and
an ass was executed in his stead, and he himself was suddenly transposed into Nachmanides’
house. From that time Nachmanides avowed himself a disciple of the Kabbalah, and was
initiated into its mysteries.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14240src" href="#xd31e14240">2</a> His numerous writings, an account of which will be found in Alexander’s edition of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>Kitto’s Cyclopædia, under <span class="sc">Nachmanides</span>, are pervaded with the tenets of this system. In the Introduction to his Commentary
on the Pentateuch he remarks—“We possess a faithful tradition that the whole Pentateuch
consists of names of the Holy One, blessed be he; for the words may be divided into
sacred names in another sense, so that it is to be taken as an allegory. Thus the
words—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראשית ברא אלהים‎</span> in Gen. i, 1 , may be redivided into other words, <i>ex. gr.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בראש יתברא אלהים‎</span><span class="corr" id="xd31e14269" title="Not in source">.</span> In like manner is the whole Pentateuch, which consists of nothing but transpositions
and numerals of divine names.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14271src" href="#xd31e14271">3</a>
</p>
<p>5. The <i>Treatise on the Emanations</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מסכת אצילות‎</span>), supposed to have been written by R. Isaac Nasir in the first half of the twelfth
century. The following is an analysis of this production. Based upon the passage—“Jaresiah
and Eliah and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham” ( 1 Chron. viii, 27 ), which names the <i>Midrash</i> assigns to the prophet Eliah (<i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, cap. xl), this prophet is introduced as speaking and teaching under the four names
of Eliah b. Josep, Jaresiah b. Joseph, Zechariah b. Joseph and Jeroham b. Joseph.
Having stated that the secret and profounder views of the Deity are only to be communicated
to the God-fearing, and that none but the pre-eminently pious can enter into the temple
of this higher gnosis, the prophet Elias propounds the system of this secret doctrine,
which consists in the following maxims—<span class="corr" id="xd31e14290" title="Not in source">“</span>I. God at first created light and darkness, the one for the pious and the other for
the wicked, darkness having come to pass by the divine limitation of light. II. God
produced and destroyed sundry worlds, which, like ten trees planted upon a narrow
space, contend about the sap of the soil, and finally perish altogether. III. God
manifested himself in four worlds, <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>viz.—<i>Atzilah</i>, <i>Beriah</i>, <i>Jetzira</i> and <i>Asiah</i>, corresponding to the Tetragrammaton <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>. In the <i>Atzilatic luminous world</i> is the divine majesty, the Shechinah. In the <i>Briatic world</i> are the souls of the saints, all the blessings, the throne of the Deity, he who sits
on it in the form of Achtenal (the crown of God, the first <i>Sephira</i>), and the seven different luminous and splendid regions. In the <i>Jetziratic</i> world are the sacred animals from the vision of Ezekiel, the ten classes of angels
with their princes, who are presided over by the fiery Metatron, the spirits of men,
and the accessory work of the divine chariot. In the <i><span class="corr" id="xd31e14315" title="Source: Asiatic">Assiatic</span></i> world are the Ophanim, the angels who receive the prayers, who are appointed over
the will of man, who control the action of mortals, who carry on the struggle against
evil, and who are presided over by the angelic prince Synandelphon. IV. The world
was founded in wisdom and understanding ( Prov. iii, 19 ), and God in his knowledge originated fifty gates of understanding. V. God created
the world by means of the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, which are both the agencies and qualities of the Deity. The <i>ten Sephiroth</i> are called Crown, Wisdom, Intelligence, Mercy, Fear, Beauty, Victory, Majesty and
Kingdom: they are ideal and stand above the concrete world.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14326src" href="#xd31e14326">4</a>
</p>
<p>6. Jacob ben Sheshet of Gerona (flour. 1243). He wrote a Kabbalistic Treatise in rhymed
prose, entitled <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שער השמים‎</span> <i>the Gate of Heaven</i>, after Gen. xxviii, 17 . It was first published by Gabriel Warshawer in his collection of eight Kabbalistic
Essays, called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר לקוטימ בקבלה‎</span>. Warsaw, 1798. It forms the third Essay in this collection, and is erroneously entitled
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לקוטי שם טוב‎</span> <i>the Collection of Shem Tob</i>. It has now been published under its proper title, from a codex by <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>Mordecai Mortera, in the Hebrew Essays and Reviews, entitled <i>Ozar Nechmad</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוצר נחמד‎</span>) vol. iii, p. 153, &amp;c. Vienna, 1860.
</p>
<p>The characteristic feature of this school, which is the creative school, is that it
for the first time established and developed the doctrine of <i>the En Soph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין סוף‎</span>)<span class="corr" id="xd31e14365" title="Not in source">,</span> <i>the Sephiroth</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספירות‎</span>) or <i>Emanations</i>, metempsychosis (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e14377" title="Source: סוך">סוד</span> העבור‎</span>) with the doctrine of retribution (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוד הגמול‎</span>) belonging thereto, and a peculiar christology, whilst the Kabbalistic mode of exegesis
is still subordinate in it.
</p>
<p>II.—THE SCHOOL OF SEGOVIA, so called because it was founded by Jacob of Segovia, and
its disciples were either natives of this place or lived in it. The chief representatives
of this school are—
</p>
<p>1, Isaac, and 2, Jacob, junior, the two sons of Jacob Segovia, and 3, Moses b. Simon
of Burgos, who are only known by sundry fragments preserved in Kabbalistic writings.
</p>
<p>4. Todras b. Joseph Ha-Levi Abulafia, born 1234, died circa 1305. This celebrated
Kabbalist occupied a distinguished position as physician and financier in the court
of Sancho IV, King of Castile, and was a great favourite of Queen Maria de Moline;
he formed one of the <i>cortége</i> when this royal pair met Philip IV, <i>the Fair</i>, King of France in Bayonne (1290), and his advocacy of this theosophy secured for
the doctrines of the Kabbalah a kindly reception. His works on the Kabbalah are—(<i>a</i>) An Exposition of the Talmudic Hagadoth, entitled <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוצר הכבוד‎</span>, (<i>b</i>) A Commentary on Ps. xix, and (<i>c</i>) A Commentary on the Pentateuch, in which he propounds the tenets of the Kabbalah.
These works, however, have not as yet been printed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14407src" href="#xd31e14407">5</a>
</p>
<p>5. Shem Tob b. Abraham Ibn Gaon, born 1283, died circa 1332, who wrote many Kabbalistic
works.
</p>
<p>6. Isaac of Akko (flour. 1290) author of the Kabbalistic <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>Commentary on the Pentateuch, entitled <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מאירת עינים‎</span> not yet printed, with the exception of an extract published by Jellinek.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14424src" href="#xd31e14424">6</a>
</p>
<p>The characteristic of this school is that it is devoted to exegesis, and its disciples
endeavoured to interpret the Bible and the Hagada in accordance with the doctrines
of the Kabbalah.
</p>
<p>III.—THE QUASI-PHILOSOPHIC SCHOOL of Isaac b. Abraham Ibn-Latif, or Allatif. He was
born about 1270 and died about 1390. Believing that to view Judaism from an exclusively
philosophical stand-point does not shew “the right way to the sanctuary,” he endeavoured
to combine philosophy with Kabbalah. “He laid greater stress than his predecessors
on the close connection and intimate union between the spiritual and material world,
between the Creator and the creation—God is in all and everything is in him. The human
soul rises to the world-soul in earnest prayer, and unites itself therewith ‘in a
kiss,’ operates upon the Deity and brings down a divine blessing upon the nether world.
But as every mortal is not able to offer such a spiritual and divinely operative prayer,
the prophets, who were the most perfect men, had to pray for the people, for they
alone knew the power of prayer. Isaac Allatif illustrated the unfolding and self-revelation
of the Deity in the world of spirits by mathematical forms. The mutual relation thereof
is the same as that of the point extending and thickening into a line, the line into
the flat, the flat into the expanded body. Henceforth the Kabbalists used points and
lines in their mystical diagrams as much as they employed the numerals and letters
of the alphabet.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14433src" href="#xd31e14433">7</a>
</p>
<p>IV. THE SCHOOL OF ABULAFIA, founded by Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, is represented
by—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. Abulafia, the founder of it, who was born at Saragossa in 1240, and died circa
1292. For thirty years he devoted himself to the study of the Bible, the Talmud, philology,
philosophy, and medicine, making himself master of the philosophical writings of Saadia,
Bachja b. Joseph, Maimonides, and Antoli, as well as of the Kabbalistic works which
were then in existence. Finding no comfort in philosophy, he gave himself entirely
to the mysteries of the Kabbalah in their most fantastic extremes, as the ordinary
doctrine of <i>the Sephiroth</i> did not satisfy him. The ordinary doctrine of <i>the Sephiroth</i> he simply regarded as <i>a ten unity</i> instead of the Christian <i>three unity</i>. Through divine inspiration, he discovered a higher Kabbalah, by means of which the
soul can not only hold the most intimate communion with the world-soul, but obtain
the prophetic faculty. The simple intercourse with the world of spirits, which is
effected by separating the words of Holy Writ, and especially those of the divine
name, into letters, and by regarding each letter as a distinct word (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוטריקון‎</span>), or by transposing the component parts of words in every possible way to obtain
thereby peculiar expressions (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צירוף‎</span>), or by taking the letters of each word as numerals (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמטריא‎</span>), is not sufficient<span class="corr" id="xd31e14462" title="Not in source">.</span> To have the prophetic faculty and to see visions ought to be the chief aim, and these
are secured by leading an ascetic life, by banishing all worldly feelings, by retiring
into a quiet closet, by dressing oneself in white apparel, by putting on the fringed
garment and the phylacteries; by sanctifying the soul so as to be fit to hold converse
with the Deity; by pronouncing the letters composing the divine name with certain
modulations of the voice and divine pauses; by exhibiting the divine names in various
diagrams under divers energetic movements, turnings, and bendings of the body, till
the voice gets confused and the heart is filled with fervour. When one has gone through
these practices and is in such a condition, the fulness of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>Godhead is shed abroad in the human soul: the soul then unites itself with the divine
soul in a kiss, and prophetic revelations follow as a matter of course.
</p>
<p>He went to Italy, published, in Urbino (1279), a prophecy, in which he records his
conversations with the Deity, calling himself Raziel and Zechariah, because these
names are numerically the same as his own name, Abraham,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14468src" href="#xd31e14468">8</a> and preached the doctrines of the Kabbalah. In 1281 he had a call from God to convert
the Pope, Martin IV, to Judaism, for which he was thrown into prison, and narrowly
escaped a martyr’s death by fire. Seeing that his Holiness refused to embrace the
Jewish <span class="corr" id="xd31e14544" title="Source: religon">religion</span>, Abulafia went to Sicily, accompanied by several of his disciples. In Messina another
revelation from God was vouchsafed to him, announcing to him that he was the Messiah,
which he published 1284. This apocalypse also announced that the restoration of Israel
would take place in 1296; and so great was the faith which the people reposed in it,
that thousands prepared themselves for returning to Palestine. Those, however, who
did not believe in the Messiahship and in the Kabbalah of Abulafia, raised such a
violent storm of opposition against him, that he had to escape to the island of Comino,
near Malta (<i>circa</i> 1288), where he remained for some time, and wrote sundry Kabbalistic works.
</p>
<p>His Kabbalistic system may be gathered from the following analysis of his Rejoinder
to R. Solomon ben Abraham ben Adereth, who attacked his doctrines and Messianic as
well as prophetic pretensions. “There are,” says Abulafia, “four sources of knowledge—I,
The five senses, or experimental maxims; II, Abstract numbers or <i>à priori</i> maxims; III, The generally acknowledged maxims, or <i lang="la">consensus communis</i>; <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>and IV, Transmitted doctrines or traditional maxims. The Kabbalistic tradition, which
goes back to Moses, is divisible into two parts, the first of which is superior to
the second in value, but subordinate to it in the order of study. The first part is
occupied with the knowledge of the Deity, obtained by means of the doctrine of <i>the Sephiroth</i>, as propounded in the <i>Book Jetzira</i>. The followers of this part are related to those philosophers who strive to know
God from his works, and the Deity stands before them objectively as a light beaming
into their understanding. These, moreover, give to <i>the Sephiroth</i> sundry names to serve as signs for recognition; and some of this class differ but
little from Christians, inasmuch as they substitute a <i>decade</i> for the <i>triad</i>, which they identify with God, and which they learned in the school of Isaac the
Blind.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e14571" title="Not in source">“</span>The second and more important part strives to know God by means of the twenty-two
letters of the alphabet, from which, together with the vowel points and accents, those
sundry divine names are combined, which elevate the Kabbalists to the degree of prophecy,
drawing out their spirit, and causing it to be united with God and to become one with
the Deity. This is gradually effected in the following manner. The <i>ten Sephiroth</i> sublimate gradually to the upper <i>Sephira</i>, called <i>thought</i>, <i>crown</i>, or <i>primordial air</i>, which is the root of all the other <i>Sephiroth</i>, and reposes in the creative <i>En Soph</i>. In the same manner all the numerals are to be traced back to one, and all the trees,
together with their roots and branches, are converted into their original earth as
soon as they are thrown into the fire. To the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, consisting of upper, middle and lower, correspond the letters of the alphabet, which
are divided into three rows of ten letters each, the final letters inclusive, beginning
and ending with <i>Aleph</i>; as well as the human body, with its head, the two arms, loins, testicles, liver,
heart, brain, all of which unite into a higher unity and become one in the active
<span class="trans" title="nous"><span lang="grc" class="grek">νοῦς</span></span>, which in its <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>turn again unites itself with God, as the unity to which everything must return.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e14603" title="Not in source">“</span>The <i>ten Sephiroth</i> are after a higher conception, to be traced to a higher triad, which correspond to
the letters <i>Aleph</i>, <i>Beth</i>, <i>Gimmel</i>, and the three principles combined in man, the vital in the heart, the vegetable
in the liver, and the pleasurable in the brain, and also form themselves in a higher
unity. It is in this way that the Kabbalist who is initiated into the <i>prophetic</i> Kabbalah may gradually concentrate all his powers direct to one point to God, and
unite himself with the Deity, for which purpose the ideas developed in unbroken sequence,
from the permutations of numbers and letters, will serve him as steps upon which to
ascend to God.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14616src" href="#xd31e14616">9</a>
</p>
<p>Abulafia wrote no less than twenty-six grammatical, exegetical, mystical and Kabbalistic
works, and twenty-two prophetic treatises. And though these productions are of great
importance to the history of the literature and development of the Kabbalah, yet only
two of them, viz., the above-named <i>Epistle to R. Solomon</i> and the <i>Epistle to R. Abraham</i>, entitled <i>the Seven Paths of the Law</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוע נתיבות התורה‎</span>), have as yet been published.
</p>
<p>2. Joseph Gikatilla b. Abraham (flour. 1260), disciple of Abulafia. He wrote in the
interests and defence of this school the following works:—i. A Kabbalistic work entitled
<i>the Garden of Nuts</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גנת אגוז‎</span>), consisting of three parts, and treating respectively on the import of the divine
names, on the mysteries of the Hebrew letters, and on the vowel points. It was published
at Hanau, 1615. ii. The import of the vowel points entitled <i>the Book on Vowels</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר הניקוד‎</span>), or <i>the Gate to the Points</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שער הניקוד‎</span>), published in the collection of seven treatises, called <i>the Cedars of Lebanon</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ארזי לבנון‎</span>), Venice, 1601, and Cracow, 1648, of which it is the third treatise. iii. <i>The Mystery of the Shining Metal</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוד החשמל‎</span>), being a Kabbalistic exposition of the first chapter of Ezekiel, also published
in the preceding seven treatises, of which it is the fourth. iv. <i>The Gate of Light</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שער אורה‎</span>), being a treatise on the names of the Deity and the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, first published in Mantua, 1561; then Riva de Trento, 1561; Cracow, 1600. A Latin
version of it by Knorr von Rosenroth is given in the first part of the <i lang="la"><span class="corr" id="xd31e14672" title="Source: Cabbala">Kabbala</span> Denudata</i>, Sulzbach, 1677–78. v. <i>The Gates of Righteousness</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שערי צדק‎</span>), on the ten divine names answering to the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>, published at Riva de Trento, 1561. vi. <i>Mysteries</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סודות‎</span>) connected with sundry Pentateuchal ordinances, published by Jechiel Ashkenazi in
his <i>Temple of the Lord</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכל יהוה‎</span>), Venice and Dantzic, 1596–1606.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14694src" href="#xd31e14694">10</a>
</p>
<p>From the above description it will be seen that the characteristic features of this
school are the stress which its followers lay on the extensive use of the exegetical
rules called <i>Gematria</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גמטריא‎</span>), <i>Notaricon</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוטריקון‎</span>), and <i>Ziruph</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צירוף‎</span>), in the exposition of the divine names and Holy Writ, as well as in the claim to
prophetic gifts. It must, however, be remarked that in this employment of commutations,
permutations and reduction of each letter in every word to its numerical value, Abulafia
and his followers are not original.
</p>
<p>V. THE SOHAR SCHOOL, which is a combination and absorption of the different features
and doctrines of all the previous schools, without any plan or method.
</p>
<p>1236–1315. Less than a century after its birth the Kabbalah became known among Christians
through the restless efforts of Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic metaphysician
and experimental chemist. This <i lang="la">Doctor illuminatus</i>, as he was styled, in consequence of his great learning and <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>piety, was born about 1236 at Palma, in the island of Majorca. He relinquished the
military service and writing erotic poetry when about thirty, and devoted himself
to the study of theology. Being inspired with an ardent zeal for the conversion of
the Mohammedans and the Jews to Christianity, he acquired a knowledge of Arabic and
Hebrew for this purpose. In pursuing his Hebrew studies Lully became acquainted with
the mysteries of the Kabbalah, and, instead of converting his Kabbalistic teachers,
he embraced the doctrine of “the identity of the Deity and nature;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14729src" href="#xd31e14729">11</a> and there is very little doubt that the Kabbalistic method of palming their notions
on the text of Scripture, by means of the <i>Gematria</i>, <i>Notaricon</i> and <i>Ziruph</i>, suggested to him the invention of <i>the Great Art</i> (<span class="sc">Ars Magna</span>). It is therefore not to be wondered at that he had the loftiest conception of the
Kabbalah, that he regarded it as a divine science and as a genuine revelation whose
light is revealed to a rational soul.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14747src" href="#xd31e14747">12</a> It cannot be said that Lully derived as much benefit from the Mohammedans, for after
making three perilous journeys to Africa to bring the sons of Ishmael to the truth
of Christianity, he was stoned to death by them, June 30, 1315.
</p>
<p>The new era in the development of the Kabbalah, created by the appearance of the <i>Sohar</i>, has continued to the present day, for nearly all those who have since espoused the
doctrines of this theosophy have made the <i>Sohar</i> their text-book, and the principal writers have contented themselves more or less
with writing commentaries on this gigantic pseudonym.
</p>
<p>1290–1350. Foremost among these is Menahem di Recanti, who was born in Recanti (Latin
Recinetum) about 1290. He wrote, when about forty years of age (1330), a commentary
<span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>on the Pentateuch, which is little else than a commentary on the <i>Sohar</i>. This commentary—which was first published by Jacob b. Chajim in Bomberg’s celebrated
printing establishment, Venice, 1523, then again, <i>ibid<span class="corr" id="xd31e14772" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, 1545, and in Lublin, 1595—has been translated into Latin by the famous Pico della
Mirandola.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14774src" href="#xd31e14774">13</a>
</p>
<p>1320. At the beginning of the fourteenth century Joseph b. Abraham Ibn Wakkar (flour.
1290–1340) endeavoured to reconcile this theosophy with philosophy, and to this end
wrote a Treatise on the cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah, which is regarded as one
of the best if not the best introductory compendium. This production, which is unpublished,
and a MS. of which exists in the Bodleian Library (Codex Land. 119; described by Uri
No. 384), consists of four parts or <i>Gates</i>, subdivided into chapters, as follows:—
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gate I</span>, which is entitled, <i>On the views of the Kabbalists respecting the Primary Cause, blessed be he, and the
Sephiroth, as well as their names and order</i>, consists of eight chapters, treating respectively on the fundamental doctrines of
the emanations of the <i>Sephiroth</i> from the First Cause, as transmitted from Abraham and indicated in the Bible and
the Rabbinic writings in <i>Gematrias</i> (cap. i); on the unity of the <i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. ii); the relation of the <i>Sephiroth</i> to each other, the First Cause itself being a trinity consisting of a threefold light,
the number of the <i>Sephiroth</i> being from 10, 20, 30 and so on up to 310, stating that there is a difference of
opinion amongst the Kabbalists whether the Primary Cause is within or without the
<i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. iii); on the three worlds of the <i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. iv); on the beginninglessness of the first and necessary first Emanation, investigating
the question as to how many <i>Sephiroth</i> this property extends (cap. v); on <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>the subordination and order of the <i>Sephiroth</i> and the diagrams, mentioning, in addition to the three known ones, the figure of
bridegroom and bride under the nuptial canopy (cap. vi); on the names of the Deity
and the angels derived from the <i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. vii); on the unclean (demon) <i>Sephiroth</i> or Hells (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קליפות‎</span>) and their relation to the pure ones (cap. viii).
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gate II</span>, which is entitled, <i>On the influence of the Sephiroth on the government of the world</i> (<i>Providence</i>), consists of six chapters, treating respectively on the relation of the <i>Sephiroth</i> to the fundamental characteristics of Providence, such as mercy, justice, &amp;c. (cap.
i); on the corresponding relations of the unclean <i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. ii); on the influence of the <i>Sephiroth</i> on men, especially on the Hebrew race, and their vicissitudes (caps. iii and iv);
on the possibility of the <i>Sephiroth</i> withholding this influence (cap. v); and on the relation of the <i>Sephiroth</i> to the days of the week (cap. vi).
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gate III</span>, which is entitled, <i>On the names of the Sephiroth among the Kabbalists</i>, and which is the most extensive part of the work, consists of seven chapters, treating
respectively on the names of the Deity, giving the sundry explanations of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהיה אשר אהיה‎</span> current among the Jewish philosophers (cap. <span class="corr" id="xd31e14851" title="Source: l">i</span>); on the names of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, stating that there is no uniform principle among the Kabbalists; that the appellations
are derived from the Bible, the Talmud and later literati; that the greatest difference
of opinion prevails among the Kabbalists as to the mode in which these ancient sources
are to be interpreted, recommending the following works as reliable guides: the Talmud,
Midrash Rabboth, Siphra, Siphri, Bahir, Perakim of R. Eliezer, the opinions of Nachmanides
and Todros Ha-Levi Abulafia of honoured memory, but guarding against the <i>Sohar</i>, because “<i>many blunders occur therein</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e14860" title="Not in source">”</span> (cap. ii); on the import of the names of the <i>Sephiroth</i>, with examples of interpretation of the Bible and Talmud <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>to serve as aids for the student who is to prosecute the work according to these examples,
mentioning three explanations of the word <i>Sephira</i> (cap. iii); on the divine names occurring in the Pentateuch (cap. iv); on the masculine
and feminine nature of the <i>Sephiroth</i> (cap. v); this is followed (cap. vi) by an alphabetical dictionary of the names of
the <i>Sephiroth</i>, giving under each letter the Biblical and the corresponding Talmudic appellation
appropriated by the Kabbalists to the <i>Sephiroth</i>; and (cap. vii) by an index of the names of each <i>Sephira</i> in alphabetical order without any explanation.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gate IV</span>, which is entitled <i>On the positive proofs of the existence of the Kabbalah</i>, describes the author’s own views of the Kabbalistic system, and submits that the
Kabbalist has a preference over the philosopher and astronomer by virtue of the acknowledged
maxim that he has a thorough knowledge of a thing who knows most details about it.
Now the Kabbalists build their system upon the distinction of words, letters, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., in the sacred writings; and they also explain certain formularies among the Rabbins,
which have undoubtedly a recondite sense.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14883src" href="#xd31e14883">14</a>
</p>
<p>1370–1500. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Kabbalah took deep root
in Spain. Its followers, who were chiefly occupied with the study of <i>the Sohar</i>, with editing some older works, and with writing Kabbalistic commentaries on the
Bible, became more and more aggressive, denouncing in unmeasured terms their co-religionists
who could not see the advantages of this secret doctrine. Thus Abraham b. Isaac of
Granada—who wrote (1391–1409) a Kabbalistic work entitled <i>The Covenant of Peace</i>, discussing <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>the mysteries of the names of God and the angels, of permutations, commutations, the
vowel points and accents—declares that he who does not acknowledge God in the manner
of the Kabbalah sins unwittingly, is not regarded by God, has not his special providence,
and, like the abandoned and the wicked, is left to fate.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14897src" href="#xd31e14897">15</a>
</p>
<p>Similar in import and tone are the writings of Shem Tob Ibn Shem Tob (died 1430).
In his Treatise, entitled <i>the Book of Faithfulness</i>, which is an attack on the Jewish philosophers Ibn Ezra, Maimonides, Levi b. Gershon,
&amp;c., and a defence of the Kabbalah, Shem Tob denounces the students of philosophy
as heretics, and maintains that the salvation of Israel depends upon the Kabbalah.
He also wrote Homilies on the Pentateuch, the Feasts and Fasts, &amp;c., in which the
Kabbalistic doctrines are fully propounded.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14907src" href="#xd31e14907">16</a>
</p>
<p>Moses Botarel or Botarelo, also a Spaniard, wrote at this time (1409) his commentary
on the famous <i>Book Jetzira</i>, an analysis of which is given in the foregoing part of this Essay (<i lang="la">vide supra</i>, p. 147, &amp;c.) Unlike Abraham of Granada and Shem Tob, his two contemporary champions
of the Kabbalah, he praises philosophy, speaks of Aristotle as of a prophet, and maintains
that philosophy and the Kabbalah propound exactly the some doctrines, and that they
only differ in language and in technical terms. In this commentary, which he wrote
to instruct the Christian scholar Maestro Juan in the Kabbalah, Botarel shows how,
by fasting, ablutions, prayer, invocation of divine and angelic names, a man may have
such dreams as shall disclose to him the secrets of the future. In confirmation of
his opinions he quotes such ancient authorities as Rab Ashi, Saadia Gaon, Hai Gaon,
&amp;c., whom the Kabbalah claims as its great <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>pillars.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14925src" href="#xd31e14925">17</a> It is almost needless to remark that these men lived long before the birth of the
Kabbalah, and that this mode of palming comparatively modern opinions upon great men
of remote ages, has also been adopted by advocates of other systems who were anxious
to invest their views with the halo of antiquity.
</p>
<p>As countrymen of the foregoing writers, and as exponents of the opinions of older
Kabbalists, are to be mentioned—(i) Jehudah Chajath who was among the large number
of Jews expelled from Spain in 1493, and who wrote a commentary on the Kabbalistic
work, entitled <i>The Divine Order</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14934src" href="#xd31e14934">18</a> and (ii) Abraham Ibn Sabba, who was banished with thousands of his brethren from
Lisbon, 1499, and who is the author of a very extensive commentary on the Pentateuch,
entitled <i>The Bundle of Myrrh</i>, in which he largely avails himself of the <i>Sohar</i> and other earlier Kabbalistic works.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14947src" href="#xd31e14947">19</a>
</p>
<p>1463–1494. The Kabbalah, which soon after its birth became partially known to Christians
through Raymond Lully, was now accessible to Christian scholars through the exertions
and influence of the famous Count John Pico di Mirandola (born in 1463). This celebrated
philosopher determined to fathom the mysteries of the Kabbalah, and for this purpose
put himself under the tuition of a Jew, R. Jochanan Aleman, who came to Italy from
Constantinople. His extraordinary intellectual powers soon enabled Mirandola to overcome
the difficulties and to unravel the secrets of this theosophy. His labours were greatly
rewarded; for, according to his shewing, <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>he found that<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14957src" href="#xd31e14957">20</a> there is more Christianity in the Kabbalah than Judaism; he discovered in it proof
for the doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the divinity of Christ, original
sin, the expiation thereof by Christ, the heavenly Jerusalem, the fall of the angels,
the order of the angels, purgatory and hell-fire; in fact the same Gospel which we
find in St. Paul, Dionysius, St. Jerome and St. Augustine. As the result of his Kabbalistic
studies Mirandola published, in 1486, when only twenty-four years of age, <i>nine hundred Theses</i>, which were placarded in Rome, and which he undertook to defend in the presence of
all European scholars, whom he invited to the eternal city, promising to defray their
travelling expenses. Among these <i>Theses</i> was the following, “<i>No science yields greater proof of the divinity of Christ than magic and the Kabbalah.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14975src" href="#xd31e14975">21</a> Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484) was so delighted with it that he greatly exerted himself
to have Kabbalistic writings translated into Latin for the use of divinity students.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e14983src" href="#xd31e14983">22</a> Mirandola accordingly translated the following three works: 1, Menahem di Recanti’s
Commentary on the Pentateuch, erroneously called <i>R. Levi</i> de Recineto (Wolf, <i>ibid<span class="corr" id="xd31e14998" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, p. 10); 2, Eliezer of Worms’ <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכמת הנפש‎</span> <i lang="la">de Scientia animae</i>; and 3, Shem Tob Falaquera’s <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר המעלות‎</span>
</p>
<p>1455–1522. Not only did Mirandola make the Kabbalah known to the Christians in Italy,
but he was the means of introducing it into Germany through John Reuchlin, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>father of the German Reformation. This eminent scholar,—who is also called by the
Greek name <i>Capnion</i> (<span class="trans" title="kapnion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">καπνίον</span></span>), or <i>Capnio</i>, which is a translation of his German name <span class="sc">Reuchlin</span>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>smoke</i>, in accordance with the fashion of the time; just as <span class="sc">Gerard</span>, signifying <i>amiable</i>, assumed the name of <span class="sc">Desiderius Erasmus</span>, and <span class="sc">Schwartzerth</span>, denoting <i>black earth</i>, took the name of <span class="sc">Melanchthon</span>,—was born at Phorzheim December 28, 1455. At the age of seventeen he was called to
the court of Baden, and received among the court singers in consequence of his beautiful
voice. His brilliant attainments soon attracted notice, and he was sent (1473) with
the young Margrave Frederick, eldest son of Charles II, afterwards bishop of Utrecht,
to the celebrated high school of Paris. Here he acquired, from Hermonymus of Sparta
and other fugitive Greek literati, who went to Paris after the taking of Constantinople
(1453), that remarkable knowledge of Greek which enabled him so largely to amass the
Attic lore and rendered him so famous through Europe. He went to Basle in 1474, delivered
lectures on the Latin language and the classics, and had among his hearers nobles
of high rank both from France and Germany. He went to Tübingen in 1481, where his
fame secured for him the friendship of Eberhard the Bearded, who made him his private
secretary and privy councillor, and as such this prince took Reuchlin with him to
Rome in 1482, where he made that splendid Latin oration before the Pope and the cardinals,
which elicited from his Holiness the declaration that Reuchlin deserved to be placed
among the best orators of France and Italy. From Rome Eberhard took him to Florence,
and it was here that Reuchlin became acquainted with the celebrated Mirandola and
with the Kabbalah. But as he was appointed licentiate and assessor of the supreme
court in Stuttgard, the new residence of Eberhard, on his return in 1484, and as the
order of Dominicans elected him as their proctor in the whole of Germany, <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>Reuchlin had not time to enter at once upon the study of Hebrew and Aramaic, which
are the key to the Kabbalah, and he had reluctantly to wait till 1492, when he accompanied
Eberhard to the imperial court at Ling. Here he became acquainted with R. Jacob b.
Jechiel Loanz, a learned Hebrew, and court physician of Frederick III, from whom he
learned Hebrew.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15053src" href="#xd31e15053">23</a> Whereupon Reuchlin at once betook himself to the study of <i>the Kabbalah</i>, and within two years of his beginning to learn the language in which it is written,
his first Kabbalistic treatise, entitled <i lang="la">De Verbo Mirifico</i> (Basle, 1494), appeared. This treatise is of the greatest rarity, and the following
analysis of it is given by Franck. It is in the form of a dialogue between an Epicurean
philosopher named Sidonius, a Jew named Baruch, and the author, who is introduced
by his Greek name Capnio, and consists of three books, according to the number of
speakers.
</p>
<p>Book I, the exponent of which is Baruch the Jewish Kabbalist, is occupied with a refutation
of the Epicurean doctrines; and simply reproduces the arguments generally urged against
this system, for which reason we omit any further description of it.
</p>
<p>Book II endeavours to shew that all wisdom and true philosophy are derived from the
Hebrews, that Plato, Pythagoras and Zoroaster borrowed their ideas from the Bible,
and that traces of the Hebrew language are to be found in the liturgies and sacred
books of all nations. Then follows an explanation of the four divine names, which
are shown to have been transplanted into the systems of Greek philosophy. The first
and most distinguished of them <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהיה אשר אהיה‎</span> <i lang="la">ego sum qui sum</i> ( Exod. iii, 12 ), is translated in the Platonic philosophy by <span class="trans" title="to ontōs ōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὸ <span class="corr" id="xd31e15082" title="Source: ὄυντως">ὄντως</span> ὢν</span></span>. The second divine name, which we translate by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הוא‎</span> <span class="sc">He</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, the sign of unchangeableness and <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>of the eternal idea of the Deity, is also to be found among the Greek philosophers
in the term <span class="trans" title="tauton"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ταυτὸν</span></span>, which is opposed to <span class="trans" title="thateron"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θατερὸν</span></span>. The third name of God used in Holy Writ is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אש‎</span> <span class="sc">Fire</span>. In this form God appeared in the burning bush when he first manifested himself to
Moses. The prophets describe him as a burning fire, and John the Baptist depicts him
as such when he says, “I baptize you with water, but he who cometh after me shall
baptize you with fire.” ( Matt. iii, 11 .) The fire of the Hebrew prophets is the same as the ether (<span class="trans" title="aithēr"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e15134" title="Source: αἰ θὴρ">αἰθὴρ</span></span></span>) mentioned in the hymns of Orpheus. But these three names are in reality only one,
showing to us the divine nature in three different aspects. Thus God calls himself
<i>the Being</i>, because every existence emanates from him; he calls himself <i>Fire</i>, because it is he who illuminates and animates all things and he is always <span class="sc">He</span>, because he always remains like himself amidst the infinite variety of his works.
Now just as there are names which express the nature of the Deity, so there are names
which refer to his attributes, and these are the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>. If we look away from every attribute and every definite point of view in which the
divine subsistence may be contemplated, if we endeavour to depict the absolute Being
as concentrating himself within himself, and not affording us any explicable relation
to our intellect, he is then described by a name which it is forbidden to pronounce,
by the thrice holy Tetragrammaton, the name Jehovah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span>) <i>the Shem Ha-Mephorash</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שם המפורש‎</span>).
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the tetrad (<span class="trans" title="tetraktys"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τετρακτύς</span></span>) of Pythagoras is an imitation of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, and that the worship
of the decade has simply been invented in honour of the <i>ten Sephiroth</i>. The four letters composing this name represent the four fundamental constituents
of the body (<i>i.e.</i>, heat, cold, dryness and humidity), the four geometrical principal points (<i>i.e.</i>, the point, the line, flat and body), the four notes of the musical scale, the four
rivers in the earthly <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>paradise, the four symbolical figures in the vision of Ezekiel, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Moreover
if we look at these four letters separately we shall find that each of them has equally
a recondite meaning. The first letter <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span>, which also stands for the number <i>ten</i>, and which by its form reminds us of the mathematical point, teaches us that God
is the beginning and end of all things. The number <i>five</i>, expressed by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span> the second letter, shows us the union of God with nature—of God inasmuch as he is
depicted by the number three, <i>i.e.</i>, the Trinity; and of visible nature, inasmuch as it is represented by Plato and Pythagoras
under the dual. The number <i>six</i>, expressed by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span>, the third letter, which is likewise revered in the Pythagorean school, is formed
by the combination of one, two, and three, the symbol of all perfection. Moreover
the number <i>six</i> is the symbol of the cube, the bodies (<i lang="la">solida</i>), or the world. Hence it is evident that the world has in it the imprint of divine
perfection. The fourth and last letter of this divine name (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span>) is like the second, represents the number <i>five</i>, and here symbolizes the human and rational soul, which is the medium between heaven
and earth, just as five is the centre of the decade, the symbolic expression of the
totality of things.
</p>
<p>Book III, the exponent of which is Capnio, endeavours to shew that the most essential
doctrines of Christianity are to be found by the same method. Let a few instances
of this method suffice. Thus the doctrine of the Trinity is to be found in the first
verse of Genesis. If the Hebrew word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברא‎</span> which is translated <i>created</i>, be examined, and if each of the three letters composing this word be taken as the
initial of a separate word, we obtain the expressions <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בן רוח אב‎</span> <i>Son</i>, <i>Spirit</i>, <i>Father</i>. Upon the same principle we find the two persons of the Trinity in the words, “the
stone which the builders refused is become the heed stone of the corner” ( Ps. cxviii, 22 ), inasmuch as the three letters composing the <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אבן‎</span> <i>stone</i>, are to be divided into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אב בן‎</span> <i>Father</i>, <i>Son</i>. Orpheus, in his hymn on the night, described the Trinity of the New Testament in
the words, <span class="trans" title="nyx, ouranos, aithēr"><span lang="grc" class="grek">νὺξ, οὐρανὸς, αἰθὴρ</span></span>, for night which begets everything can only designate <i>the Father</i>; heaven, that olyphus which in its boundlessness embraces all things, and which proceeded
from the night, signifies <i>the Son</i>; whilst ether, which the ancient poet also designates <i>fiery breath</i>, is the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. The name Jesus in Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י״ה״ש״ו״ה‎</span> the <span class="trans" title="pentagrammaton"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πενταγράμματον</span></span> yields the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יהוה‎</span> <i>Jehovah</i>; and the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span> which in the language of the Kabbalah is the symbol of fire or light, which St. Jerome,
in his mystical exposition of the alphabet, has made the sign of the <span class="trans" title="Logos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Λόγος</span></span>. This mysterious name therefore contains a whole revelation, inasmuch as it shows
us that Jesus is God himself, the Light or the <i>Logos</i>. Even the cross, which is the symbol of Christianity, is plainly indicated in the
Old Testament, by the tree of life which God planted in the midst of the garden; by
the praying attitude of Moses, when he raised his hands towards heaven in his intercession
for Israel during the combat with Amalek; and by the tree which converted the bitter
waters into sweet in the wilderness of Marah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15291src" href="#xd31e15291">24</a>
</p>
<p>The Treatise <i lang="la">de Verbo Mirifico</i> is, however, only an introduction to another work on the same subject which Reuchlin
published twenty-two years later, entitled <i lang="la">De Arte Cabalistica</i>. Hagenau, 1516. This Treatise, like the first, is in the form of a dialogue between
a Mohammedan named Marrianus, a Pythagorean Philosopher named Philolaus, and a Jewish
doctor named Simon. The dialogue is held in Frankfort, where the Jew resides, to whom
the Mohammedan and Pythagorean resort to be initiated into the mysteries of the Kabbalah.
The whole is a more matured exposition and elaboration of the ideas hinted at in his
first work.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kabbalah, according to Reuchlin, is a symbolical reception of Divine revelation;
and a distinction is to be made between <i>Cabalici</i>, to whom belongs heavenly inspiration, their disciples <i>Cabalaai</i>, and their imitators <i>Cabalistae</i>. The design of the Kabbalah is to propound the relations of the absolute Creator
to the creature. God is the Creator of all beings which emanated from him, and he
implanted aspirations in them to attain actual communion with him. In order that feeble
man might attain this communion, God revealed himself to mankind in various ways,
but especially to Moses. This Divine revelation to Moses contains far more than appears
on the surface of the Pentateuch. There is a recondite wisdom concealed in it which
distinguishes it from other codes of morals and precepts. There are in the Pentateuch
many pleonasms and repetitions of the same things and words, and as we cannot charge
God with having inserted useless and superfluous words in the Holy Scriptures, we
must believe that something more profound is contained in them, to which the Kabbalah
gives the key.
</p>
<p>This key consists in permutations, commutations, &amp;c., &amp;c. But this act of exchanging
and arranging letters, and of interpreting for the edification of the soul the Holy
Scriptures, which we have received from God as a divine thing not to be understood
by the multitude, was not communicated by Moses to everybody, but to the elect, such
as Joshua, and so by tradition it came to the seventy interpreters. This gift is called
<i>Kabbalah</i>. God, out of love to his people, has revealed hidden mysteries to some of them, and
these have found the living spirit in the dead letter; that is to say, the Scriptures
consist of separate letters, visible signs which stand in a certain relation to the
angels as celestial and spiritual emanations from God; and by pronouncing them, the
latter also are affected. To a true Kabbalist, who has an insight into the whole connection
of the terrestrial with the celestial, these <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>signs thus put together are the means of placing him in close union with spirits,
who are thereby bound to fulfil his wishes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15320src" href="#xd31e15320">25</a>
</p>
<p>The extraordinary influence which Reuchlin’s Kabbalistic Treatises exercised upon
the greatest thinkers of the time and upon the early reformers may be judged of from
the unmeasured terms of praise which they bestowed upon their author. The Treatises
were regarded as heavenly communications, revealing new divine wisdom. Conrad Leontarius,
writing to Wimpheling on the subject, says—“I never saw anything more beautiful or
admirable than this work (<i>i.e.</i>, <i lang="la">De Verbo Mirifico</i>), which easily convinces him who reads it that no philosopher, whether Jew or Christian,
is superior to Reuchlin.” Aegidius, general of the Eremites, wrote to the holy Augustine
“that Reuchlin had rendered him, as well as the rest of mankind, happy by his works,
which had made known to all a thing hitherto unheard of.” Philip Beroaldus, the younger,
sent him word “that Pope Leo X had read his Pythagorean book greedily, as he did all
good books; afterwards the Cardinal de Medici had done so, and he himself should soon
enjoy it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15332src" href="#xd31e15332">26</a> Such was the interest which this newly-revealed Kabbalah created among Christians,
that not only learned men but statesmen and warriors began to study the oriental languages,
in order to be able to fathom the mysteries of this theosophy.
</p>
<p>1450–1498. Whilst the Kabbalah was gaining such high favour amongst Christians both
in Italy and Germany, through the exertions of Mirandola and Reuchlin, a powerful
voice was raised among the Jews against <i>the Sohar</i>, the very Bible of this theosophy. Elia del Medigo, born at Candia, then in Venetia,
1450, of a German literary family, professor of <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>philosophy in the University of Padua, teacher of Pico de Mirandola, and a scholar
of the highest reputation both among his Jewish brethren and among Christians, impugned
the authority of <i>the Sohar</i>. In his philosophical Treatise on the nature of Judaism as a harmonizer between religion
and philosophy, entitled <i>An Examination of the Law</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בחינת הדת‎</span>), which he wrote December 29, 1491, he puts into the mouth of an antagonist to the
Kabbalah the following three arguments against the genuineness of the <i>Sohar</i>: 1, Neither the Talmud, nor the Gaonim and Rabbins knew anything of the <i>Sohar</i> or of its doctrines; 2, The <i>Sohar</i> was published at a very late period; and 3, Many anachronisms occur in it, inasmuch
as it describes later Amoraic authorities as having direct intercourse with the Tanaite
R. Simon b. Jochai who belongs to an earlier period.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15359src" href="#xd31e15359">27</a>
</p>
<p>1522–1570. The voice of Elia del Medigo and others, however, had no power to check
the rapid progress of the Kabbalah, which had now found its way from Spain and Italy
into Palestine and Poland, and penetrated all branches of life and literature. Passing
over the host of minor advocates and teachers, we shall mention the two great masters
in Palestine, who formed two distinct schools, distinguished by the prominence which
they respectively gave to certain doctrines of the Kabbalah. The first of these is
Moses Cordovero, also called <i>Remak</i> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רמ׳ק‎</span> from the acrostic of his name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קורדואירו‎</span> <i>R. Moses Cordovero</i>. He was born in Cordova, 1522, studied the Kabbalah under his learned brother-in-law,
Solomon Aleavez, and very soon became so distinguished as a Kabbalist and author that
his fame travelled to Italy, where his works were greedily bought. His principal works
are: 1, An Introduction to the Kabbalah, entitled <i>A Sombre</i> or <i>Sweet <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>Light</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אור נערב‎</span>) first published in Venice, 1587, then in Cracow, 1647, and in Fürth, 1701; 2, Kabbalistic
reflections and comments on ninety-nine passages of the Bible, entitled <i>The Book of Retirement</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר נרושין‎</span>), published in Venice, 1543; and 3, A large Kabbalistic work entitled <i>The Garden of Pomegranates</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרדס רמונים‎</span>), which consists of thirteen sections or gates (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שערים‎</span>) subdivided into chapters, and discusses <i>the Sephiroth</i>, the Divine names, the import and significance of the letters, &amp;c., &amp;c. It was first
published in Cracow, 1591. Excerpts of it have been translated into Latin by Bartolocci,
<i lang="la">Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica</i>, vol. iv, p. 231, &amp;c., and Knorr von Rosenroth, <i lang="la">Tractatus de Anima ex libro Pardes Rimmonim</i> in his <i lang="la"><span class="corr" id="xd31e15413" title="Source: Cabbala">Kabbala</span> Denudata</i>, Sulzbach, 1677.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15417src" href="#xd31e15417">28</a>
</p>
<p>The peculiar feature of Cordovero is that he is chiefly occupied with the scientific
speculations of the Kabbalah, or <i>the speculative Kabbalah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלה עיונית‎</span>), as it is called in the modern terminology of this esoteric doctrine, in contra-distinction
to <i>the wonder-working Kabbalah</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלה מעשית‎</span>), keeping aloof to a great extent from the extravagances which we shall soon have
to notice. In this respect therefore he represents the Kabbalah in its primitive state,
as may be seen from the following specimen of his lucubrations on the nature of the
Deity. “The knowledge of the Creator is different from that of the creature, since
in the case of the latter, knowledge and the thing known are distinct, thus leading
to subjects which are again separate from him. This is described by the three expressions—cogitation,
the cogitator and the cogitated object. Now the Creator is himself knowledge, knowing
and the known object. His knowledge does not consist in the fact that he directs his
thoughts to things <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>without him, since in comprehending and knowing himself, he comprehends and knows
everything which exists. There is nothing which is not united with him, and which
he does not find in his own substance. He is the archetype of all things existing,
and all things are in him in their purest and most perfect form; so that the perfection
of the creatures consists in the support whereby they are united to the primary source
of his existence, and they sink down and fall from that perfect and lofty position
in proportion to their separation from him.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15441src" href="#xd31e15441">29</a>
</p>
<p>1534–1572. The opposite to this school is the one founded by Isaac Luria or Loria,
also called <i>Ari</i> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אר״י‎</span> from the initials of his name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏האשכנזי ר׳ יצחק‎</span> <i>R. Isaac Ashkanazi</i>. He was born at Jerusalem 1534, and, having lost his father when very young, was
taken by his mother to Kahira, where he was put by his rich uncle under the tuition
of the best Jewish master. Up to his twenty-second year he was a diligent student
of the Talmud and the Rabbinic lore, and distinguished himself in these departments
of learning in a most remarkable manner. He then lived in retirement for about seven
years to give free scope to his thoughts and meditations, but he soon found that simple
retirement from collegiate studies did not satisfy him. He therefore removed to the
banks of the Nile, where he lived in a sequestered cottage for several years, giving
himself up entirely to meditations and reveries. Here he had constant interviews with
the prophet Elias, who communicated to him sublime doctrines. Here, too, his soul
ascended to heaven whenever he was asleep, and in the celestial regions held converse
with the souls of the great teachers of bygone days. When thirty-six years of age
(1570) the Prophet Elias appeared to him again and told him to go to Palestine, where
his successor was awaiting him. Obedient to the command, he went to Safet, where he
gathered <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>round him ten disciples, visited the sepulchres of ancient teachers, and there, by
prostrations and prayers, obtained from their spirits all manner of revelations, so
much so that he was convinced he was the Messiah b. Joseph and that he was able to
perform all sorts of miracles. It was this part of the Kabbalah, <i>i.e.</i>, the ascetic and miraculous (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כבלה מעשית‎</span>), which Loria taught. His sentiments he delivered orally, as he himself did not write
anything, except perhaps some marginal notes of a critical import in older books and
MSS. His disciples treasured up his marvellous sayings, whereby they performed miracles
and converted thousands to the doctrines of this theosophy.
</p>
<p>1543–1620. The real exponent of Loria’s Kabbalistic system is his celebrated disciple
Chajim Vital, a descendant of a Calabrian family, who died in 1620 at the age of seventy-seven.
After the demise of his teacher, Chajim Vital diligently collected all the MS. notes
of the lectures which Loria’s disciples had written down, from which, together with
his own jottings, he produced the gigantic and famous system of the Kabbalah, entitled
<i>the Tree of Life</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עץ החיים‎</span>). This work, over which Vital laboured thirty years, was at first circulated in MS.
copies, and every one of the Kabbalistic disciples had to pledge himself, under pain
of excommunication, not to allow a copy to be made for a foreign land; so that for
a time all the Codd. remained in Palestine. At last, however, this Thesaurus of the
Kabbalah, which properly consists of six works, was published by J. Satanow at Zolkiev,
1772. New editions of it appeared in Korez, 1785; Sklow, 1800; Dobrowne, 1804; Stilikow,
1818; and Knorr von Rosenroth has translated into Latin a portion of that part of
the great work which treats on <i>the doctrine of the metempsychosis</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגלגולים‎</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15479src" href="#xd31e15479">30</a>
</p>
<p>1558–1560. The circulation of Loria’s work which gave <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>an extraordinary impetus to the Kabbalah, and which gave rise to the new school and
a separate congregation in Palestine, was not the only favourable circumstance which
had arisen to advance and promulgate the esoteric doctrine. The <i>Sohar</i>, which since its birth had been circulated in MS., was now for the first time printed
in Mantua, and thousands of people who had hitherto been unable to procure the MS.
were thus enabled to possess themselves of copies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15495src" href="#xd31e15495">31</a> It is, however, evident that with the increased circulation of these two Bibles of
the Kabbalah, as the <i>Sohar</i> and Loria’s <i>Etz Chajim</i> are called, there was an increased cry on the part of learned Jews against the doctrines
propounded in them. Isaac b. Immanuel de Lates, the Rabbi of Pesaro, and the great
champion for the Kabbalah, who prefixed a commendatory epistle to the <i>Sohar</i>, tells us most distinctly that some Rabbins wanted to prevent the publication of
the <i>Sohar</i>, urging that it ought to be kept secret or be burned, because it tends to heretical
doctrines.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15509src" href="#xd31e15509">32</a>
</p>
<p>1571–1648. Of the numerous opponents to the Kabbalah which the <i>Sohar</i> and Loria’s work called forth, Leo de Modena was by far the most daring, the most
outspoken and the most powerful. This eminent scholar who is known to the Christian
world by his celebrated <i>History of the Rites, Customs and Manners of the Jews</i>, which was originally written in Italian, published in Padua, 1640, and which has
been translated into Latin, English, French, Dutch, &amp;c., attacked the Kabbalah in
two of his works. His first onslaught is on the doctrine of metempsychosis in his
Treatise entitled <i>Ben David</i>. He composed this Treatise in 1635–36, at the request of David Finzi, of Egypt, and
he demonstrates therein that this doctrine <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>is of Gentile origin, and was rejected by the great men of the Jewish faith in bygone
days, refuting at the same time the philosophico-theological arguments advanced in
its favour.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15529src" href="#xd31e15529">33</a> It is, however, his second attack on this esoteric doctrine, in his work entitled
<i>The Roaring Lion</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ארי נוהם‎</span>), which is so damaging to the Kabbalah. In this Treatise—which Leo de Modena composed
in 1639, at the advanced age of sixty-eight, to reclaim Joseph Chamiz, a beloved disciple
of his, who was an ardent follower of the Kabbalah—he shows that the books which propound
this esoteric doctrine, and which are palmed upon ancient authorities, are pseudonymous;
that the doctrines themselves are mischievous; and that the followers of this system
are inflated with proud notions, pretending to know the nature of God better than
anyone else, and to possess the nearest and best way of approaching the Deity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15541src" href="#xd31e15541">34</a>
</p>
<p>1623. The celebrated Hebraist, Joseph Solomon del Medigo (born 1591, died 1637), a
contemporary of the preceding writer, also employed his vast stores of erudition to
expose this system. Having been asked by R. Serach for his views of the Kabbalah,
del Medigo, in a masterly letter, written in 1623, shows up the folly of this esoteric
doctrine, and the unreasonableness of the exegetical rules, whereby the followers
of this system pretend to deduce it from the Bible.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15557src" href="#xd31e15557">35</a>
</p>
<p>1635. We have seen that the information about the Kabbalah, which Mirandola and Reuchlin
imparted to Christians, was chiefly derived from the writings of Recanti and Gikatilla.
Now that the <i>Sohar</i> had been published, Joseph de Voisin <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>determined to be the first to make some portions of it accessible to those Christian
readers who did not understand the Aramaic in which this Thesaurus is written. Accordingly
he translated some extracts of the <i>Sohar</i> which treat of the nature of the human soul.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15570src" href="#xd31e15570">36</a>
</p>
<p>1652–1654. Just at the very time when some of the most distinguished Jews exposed
the pretensions of the Kabbalah, and denounced the fanciful and unjustifiable rules
of interpretation whereby its advocates tried to evolve it from the letters of the
revealed law, the celebrated Athanasius Kircher, in a most learned and elaborate treatise
on this subject, maintained that the Kabbalah was introduced into Egypt by no less
a person than the patriarch Abraham; and that from Egypt it gradually issued all over
the East, and intermixed with all religions and systems of philosophy. What is still
more extraordinary is that this learned Jesuit, in thus exalting the Kabbalah, lays
the greatest stress on that part of it which developed itself afterwards, viz., the
combinations, transpositions and permutations of the letters, and does not discriminate
between it and the speculations about the <i>En Soph</i>, <i>the Sephiroth</i>, &amp;c., which were the original characteristics of this theosophy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15581src" href="#xd31e15581">37</a> The amount of Eastern lore, however, which Kircher has amassed in his work will always
remain a noble monument to the extensive learning of this Jesuit.
</p>
<p>1645–1676. The wonder-working or practical branch of the Kabbalah (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קבלה מעשית‎</span>), as it is called, so elaborately propounded and defended by Kircher, which consists
in the transpositions of the letters of the sundry divine names, &amp;c., and which as
we have seen constituted no part of the original Kabbalah, had now largely laid hold
on the minds and fancies <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>of both Jews and Christians, and was producing among the former the most mournful
and calamitous effects. The famous Kabbalist, Sabbatai Zevi, who was born in Smyrna,
July, 1641, was the chief actor in this tragedy. When a child he was sent to a Rabbinic
school, and instructed in the Law, the Mishna, the Talmud, the Midrashim, and the
whole cycle of Rabbinic lore. So great were his intellectual powers, and so vast the
knowledge he acquired, that when fifteen he betook himself to the study of the Kabbalah,
rapidly mastered its mysteries, became peerless in his knowledge of “those things
which were revealed and those things which were hidden;” and at the age of eighteen
obtained the honourable appellation <i>sage</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חכם‎</span>), and delivered public lectures, expounding the divine law and the esoteric doctrine
before crowded audiences. At the age of twenty-four he gave himself out as the Messiah,
the Son of David, and the Redeemer of Israel, pronouncing publicly the Tetragrammaton,
which was only allowed to the high priests during the existence of the second Temple.
Though the Jewish sages of Smyrna excommunicated him for it, he travelled to Salonica,
Athens, Morea and Jerusalem, teaching the Kabbalah, proclaiming himself as the Messiah,
anointing prophets and converting thousands upon thousands. So numerous were the believers
in him, that in many places trade was entirely stopped; the Jews wound up their affairs,
disposed of their chattels and made themselves ready to be redeemed from their captivity
and led by Sabbatai Zevi back to Jerusalem. The consuls of Europe were ordered to
enquire into this extraordinary movement, and the governors of the East reported to
the Sultan the cessation of commerce. Sabbatai Zevi was then arrested by order of
the Sultan, Mohammed IV, and taken before him at Adrianople. The Sultan spoke to him
as follows—“I am going to test thy Messiahship. Three poisoned arrows shall be shot
into thee, and if they do not kill thee, I too will believe that thou art the <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>Messiah.” He saved himself by embracing Islamism in the presence of the Sultan, who
gave him the name <i>Effendi</i>, and appointed him <i>Kapidgi Bashi</i>. Thus ended the career of the Kabbalist Sabbatai Zevi, after having ruined thousands
upon thousands of Jewish families.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15606src" href="#xd31e15606">38</a>
</p>
<p>1677–1684. Whether the learned Knorr Baron von Rosenroth knew of the extravagances
of Sabbatai Zevi or not is difficult to say. At all events this accomplished Christian
scholar believed that Simon b. Jochai was the author of the <i>Sohar</i>, that he wrote it under divine inspiration, and that it is most essential to the
elucidation of the doctrines of Christianity. With this conviction he determined to
master the difficulties connected with the Kabbalistic writings, in order to render
the principal works of this esoteric doctrine accessible to his Christian brethren.
For, although Lully, Mirandola, Reuchlin and Kircher had already done much to acquaint
the Christian world with the secrets of the Kabbalah, none of these scholars had given
translations of any portions of the <i>Sohar</i>.
</p>
<p>Knorr Baron von Rosenroth, therefore put himself under the tuition of R. Meier Stern,
a learned Jew, and with his assistance was enabled to publish the celebrated work
entitled the <i>Unveiled Kabbalah</i> (<span class="sc" lang="la">Kabbala Denudata</span>), in two large volumes, the first of which was printed at Sulzbach, 1677–78, and
the second at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, 1684, giving a Latin translation of the Introduction
to and the following portion of the <i>Sohar</i>—the <i>Book of Mysteries</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר דצניעותא‎</span>); the <i>Great Assembly</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא רבא‎</span>); the <i>Small Assembly</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא זוטא‎</span>); Joseph Gikatilla’s <i>Gate of Light</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שער אורה‎</span>); the <i>Doctrine of Metempsychosis</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגלגולים‎</span>), and the <i>Tree of Life</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עץ חיים‎</span>), of Chajim Vital; the <i>Garden of Pomegranates</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרדס רימונים‎</span>), of Moses Cordovero; the <i>House of the Lord</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית אלהים‎</span>), and the <i>Gate of Heaven</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שער השמים‎</span>), of <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>Abraham Herera; the <i>Valley of the King</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עמק המלך‎</span>), of Naphtah b. Jacob; the <i>Vision of the Priest</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מראה כהן‎</span>), of Issachar Beer b. Naphtali Cohen, &amp;c., &amp;c., with elaborate annotations, glossaries
and indices. The only drawback to this gigantic work is that it is without any system,
and that it mixes up in one all the earlier developments of the Kabbalah with the
later productions. Still the criticism passed upon it by Buddeus, that it is a “confused
and obscure work, in which the necessary and the unnecessary, the useful and the useless
are mixed up and thrown together as it were into one chaos,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15688src" href="#xd31e15688">39</a> is rather too severe; and it must be remembered that if the <i lang="la">Kabbala Denudata</i> does not exhibit a regular system of this esoteric doctrine, it furnishes much material
for it. Baron von Rosenroth has also collected all the passages of the New Testament
which contain similar doctrines to those propounded by the Kabbalah.
</p>
<p>1758–1763. Amongst the Jews, however, the pretensions and consequences of the Kabbalistic
Pseudo-Messiah, Sabbatai Zevi, and his followers, produced a new era in the criticism
of the <i>Sohar</i>. Even such a scholar and thorough Kabbalist as Jacob b. Zevi of Emden, or <i>Jabez</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יעב״ץ‎</span>), as he is called from the acrostic of his name (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יעקב בן צבי‎</span>), maintains in his work, which he wrote in 1758–1763, and which he entitled <i>The Wrapper of Books</i>, that with the exception of the kernel of the <i>Sohar</i> all the rest is of a late origin.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15722src" href="#xd31e15722">40</a> He shows that (1) The <i>Sohar</i> misquotes passages of Scripture, misunderstands the Talmud, and contains some rituals
which were ordained by later Rabbinic authorities (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פוסקים‎</span>). (2) Mentions the crusades against the Mohammedans. (3) Uses <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>the philosophical terminology of Ibn Tibbon’s Hebrew Translation of Maimonides’ <i>More Nebuchim</i>, and borrows the figure of Jehudah Ha-Levi’s Khosari, that “Israel is the heart in
the organism of the human race, and therefore feels its sufferings more acutely” (<i>Khosari</i>, ii, 36, with <i>Sohar</i>, iii, 221 <i>b</i>, 161 <i>a</i>); and (4) Knows the Portuguese and North Spanish expression <i>Esnoga</i>.
</p>
<p>1767. Whilst the Jews were thus shaken in their opinion about the antiquity of the
<i>Sohar</i>, learned Christians both on the Continent and in England maintained that Simon b.
Jochai was the author of the Bible of the Kabbalah, and quoted its sentiments in corroboration
of their peculiar views. Thus Dr. Gill, the famous Hebraist and commentator, in his
work on <i>the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language</i>, adduces passages from the <i>Sohar</i> to shew that the Hebrew vowel points were known <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 120, at which time he tells us “lived Simon ben Jochai, a disciple of R. Akiba, author
of the <i>Zohar</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15765src" href="#xd31e15765">41</a>
</p>
<p>1830. Allen, in the account of the Kabbalah in his <i>Modern Judaism</i>, also premises the antiquity of the <i>Sohar</i>. Taking this pseudonym as the primary source of the primitive Kabbalah, Allen, like
all his predecessors, mixes up the early mysticism and magic, as well as the later
abuse of the Hagadic rules of interpretation, denominated <i>Gematria</i>, <i>Notaricon</i>, <i>Ziruph</i>, &amp;c., which the Kabbalists afterwards appropriated, with the original doctrines of
this theosophy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15783src" href="#xd31e15783">42</a>
</p>
<p>1843. Even the erudite Professor Franck, in his excellent work <i lang="fr">La Kabbale</i> (Paris, 1843), makes no distinction between the <i>Book Jetzira</i> and the <i>Sohar</i>, but regards the esoteric doctrines of the latter as a development and continuation
of the tenets propounded in the former. He moreover maintains <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>that the <i>Sohar</i> consists of ancient and modern fragments, that the ancient portions are the <i>Book of Mysteries</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספרא דצניעותא‎</span>), <i>the Great Assembly</i> or <i>Idra Rabba</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא רבא‎</span>), and <i>the Small Assembly</i> or <i>Idra Suta</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אדרא זוטא‎</span>), and actually proceeds from the school of R. Simon b. Jochai, while several of the
other parts belong to a subsequent period, but not later than the seventh century;
that the fatherland of the <i>Sohar</i> is Palestine; that the fundamental principles of the Kabbalah, which were communicated
by R. Simon b. Jochai to a small number of his disciples, were at first propagated
orally; that they were then from the first to the seventh century gradually edited
and enlarged through additions and commentaries, and that the whole of this compilation,
completed in the seventh century, owing to its many attacks on the Asiatic religions,
was kept secret till the thirteenth century, when it was brought to Europe. To fortify
his opinions about the antiquity of the Kabbalah, Franck is obliged to palm the doctrine
of the <i>Sephiroth</i> upon passages in the Talmud in a most unnatural manner. As this point, however has
been discussed in the second part of this Essay, (<i lang="la">vide supra</i>, p. 183, etc.) there is no necessity for repeating the arguments here.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15829src" href="#xd31e15829">43</a> Still Franck’s valuable contribution to the elucidation of the <i>Sohar</i> will always be a welcome aid to the student of this difficult book.
</p>
<p>1845. A new era in the study of the Kabbalah was created by the researches of M.&nbsp;H.
Landauer, who died February 3rd, 1841, when scarcely thirty-three years of age. This
learned Rabbi, whose premature death is an irreparable loss to literature, in spite
of constitutional infirmities, which occasioned him permanent sufferings during the
short period of his earthly career, devoted himself from his youth to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>study of Hebrew, the Mishna, the Talmud, and the rich stores of Jewish learning. He
afterwards visited the universities of Munich and Tübingen, and in addition to his
other researches in the department of Biblical criticism, determined to fathom the
depths of the Kabbalah. It was this scholar who, after a careful study of this esoteric
doctrine, for the first time distinguished between the ancient mysticism of the Gaonim
period and the real Kabbalah, and shewed that “the former, as contained in the <i>Alphabet of R. Akiba</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אותיות בר׳ עקיבא‎</span>), <i>the Dimensions of the Deity</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיעור קומה‎</span>), <i>the Heavenly Mansions</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏היכלות‎</span>), and even <i>the Book of Jetzira</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר יצירה‎</span>) and similar documents, essentially differ from the later Kabbalah, inasmuch as it
knows nothing about the so-called <i>Sephiroth</i> and about the speculations respecting the nature of the Deity, and that, according
to the proper notions of the Kabbalah, its contents ought to be described as <i>Hagada</i> and not as Kabbalah.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15871src" href="#xd31e15871">44</a> As to the <i>Sohar</i>, Landauer maintains that it was written by Abraham b. Samuel Abulafia towards the
end of the second half of the thirteenth century. Landauer’s views on the Kabbalah
and on the authorship of the <i>Sohar</i>, as Steinschneider rightly remarks, are all the more weighty and instructive because
he originally started with opinions of an exactly opposite character. (<i>Jewish Literature</i>, p. 299.)
</p>
<p>1849. D.&nbsp;H. Joel, Rabbi of Sheversenz, published in 1849 a very elaborate critique
on Franck’s <i>Religious Philosophy of the Sohar</i>, which is an exceedingly good supplement to Franck’s work, though Joel’s treatise
is of a negative character, and endeavours to demolish Franck’s theory without propounding
another in its stead. Thus much, however, Joel positively states, that though the
<i>Sohar</i> in its present form <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>could not have been written by R. Simon b. Jochai, and though the author of it may
not have lived before the thirteenth century, yet its fundamental doctrines to a great
extent are not the invention of the author, but are derived from ancient Jewish sources,
either documentary or oral.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15891src" href="#xd31e15891">45</a>
</p>
<p>1851. After a lapse of seven years Jellinek fulfilled the promise which he made in
the preface to his German translation of Franck’s <i lang="fr">la Kabbale ou la philosophie religieuse des Hébreux</i>, by publishing an Essay on the authorship of the <i>Sohar</i>. And in 1851 this industrious scholar published a historico-critical Treatise, in
which he proves, almost to demonstration, that Moses b. Shem Tob de Leon is the author
of the <i>Sohar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15905src" href="#xd31e15905">46</a> Several of his arguments are given in the second part of this Essay (<i lang="la">vide supra</i>, p. 174, &amp;c.), in our examination of the age and authorship of the <i>Sohar</i>.
</p>
<p>1852. Whilst busily engaged in his researches on the authorship and composition of
the <i>Sohar</i>, Jellinek was at the same time extending his labours to the history of the Kabbalah
generally, the results of which he communicated in two parts (Leipzig, 1852), entitled
<i>Contributions to the History of the Kabbalah</i>. The first of these parts embraces (1) the study and history of the <i>Book Jetzira</i>, (2) diverse topics connected with the <i>Sohar</i>, and (3) Kabbalistic doctrines and writings prior to the <i>Sohar</i>; whilst the second part (1) continues the investigation on the Kabbalistic doctrines
and writings prior to the <i>Sohar</i>, as well as (2) discusses additional points connected with the <i>Sohar</i>, and (3) gives the original text to the history of the Kabbalah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15933src" href="#xd31e15933">47</a>
</p>
<p>1853. Supplementary to the above works, Jellinek published, <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>twelve months afterwards, the first part of a <i>Selection of Kabbalistic Mysticism</i>, which comprises the Hebrew texts of (1) <i>The Treatise on the Emanations</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מסכת אצילות‎</span>), (2) <i>The Book of Institutions</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר העיון‎</span>), by R. Chamai Gaon, (3) <i>The Rejoinder of R. Abraham b. Samuel Abulafia to R. Solomon b. Adereth</i>, and (4) The Treatise entitled <i>Kether Shem Tob</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כתר שם טוב‎</span>), by R. Abraham of Cologne. These Treatises, which are chiefly taken from MSS. at
the public Libraries in Paris and Hamburg, are preceded by learned Introductions discussing
the characteristics, the age, the authorship and the sources of each document, written
by the erudite editor.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15962src" href="#xd31e15962">48</a> May Dr. Jellinek soon fulfil his promise, and continue to edit these invaluable contributions
to the Kabbalah, as well as publish his own work on the import of this esoteric doctrine.
</p>
<p>1856. Dr. Etheridge, in his Manual on Hebrew Literature, entitled <i>Jerusalem and Tiberias</i>, devotes seventy pages to a description of the Kabbalah. It might have been expected
that this industrious writer, who draws upon Jewish sources, would give us the result
of the researches of the above-named Hebraists. But Dr. Etheridge has done no such
thing;—he confuses the import of the <i>Book Jetzira</i>, the <i>Maase Bereshith</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה בראשית‎</span>) and the <i>Maase Merkaba</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה מרכבה‎</span>), with the doctrines of the Kabbalah; and assigns both to the <i>Book Jetzira</i> and to the <i>Sohar</i> an antiquity which is contrary to all the results of modern criticism. The following
extract from his work will suffice to shew the correctness of our remarks:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“To the authenticity of the <i>Zohar</i>, as a work of the early Kabbalistic school, objections have indeed been made, but
they are not of sufficient gravity to merit an extended investigation. The opinion
that ascribes it as a <i>pseudo</i> fabrication to Moses de Leon in the thirteenth century, has, I imagine, but few believers
among the learned in this subject in our own day. The references to Shemun ben Yochai
and the Kabala in the Talmud, and abundant internal evidence found in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>book itself, exhibit the strongest probability, not that Shemun himself was the author
of it, but that it is the fruit and result of his personal instructions, and of the
studies of his immediate disciples.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e15997src" href="#xd31e15997">49</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Now the bold assertion that there are few believers among the learned of our own time
in <i>the pseudo</i> fabrication of the <i>Sohar</i> by Moses de Leon in the thirteenth century, when such learned men as Zunz,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16007src" href="#xd31e16007">50</a> Geiger,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16012src" href="#xd31e16012">51</a> Sachs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16016src" href="#xd31e16016">52</a> Jellinek<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16022src" href="#xd31e16022">53</a> and a host of other most distinguished Jewish scholars, regard it almost as an established
fact; as well as the statement that there are <i>references to the Kabbalah in the Talmud</i>, can only be accounted for from the fact that Dr. Etheridge has not rightly comprehended
the import of the Kabbalah, and that he is entirely unacquainted with the modern researches
in this department of literature.
</p>
<p>1857. The elaborate essay on Jewish literature by the learned Steinschneider, which
appeared in <i>Ersch and Gruber’s Encyclopædia</i>, and which has been translated into English, contains a most thorough review of this
esoteric doctrine. It is, however, to be remarked that the pages devoted to this subject
give not so much an analysis of the subject, as a detailed account of its literature;
and, like all the writings of this excellent scholar, are replete with most useful
information.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16032src" href="#xd31e16032">54</a>
</p>
<p>1858–1861. A most instructive and thorough analysis of the <i>Sohar</i> appeared in a Jewish periodical, entitled <i>Ben Chananja</i>, volumes i, ii, iii, and iv.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16042src" href="#xd31e16042">55</a> This analysis was <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>made by Ignatz Stern, who has also translated into German those portions of the <i>Sohar</i> which are called <i>the Book of Mysteries</i>, <i>the Great Assembly</i>, and <i>the Small Assembly</i>, and has written a vocabulary to the <i>Sohar</i>. The recent death of this great student in the Kabbalah is greatly to be lamented.
With the exception of the analysis of the <i>Sohar</i>, all his works are in MS.; and it is to be hoped that the accomplished Leopold Löw,
chief Rabbi of Szegedin, and editor of the <i>Ben Chananja</i>, who was the means of bringing the retiring Ignatz Stern into public, will publish
his literary remains.
</p>
<p>1859. As the Kabbalah has played so important a part in the mental and religious development,
and in the history of the Jewish people, the modern historians of the Jews, in depicting
the vicissitudes of the nation, felt it to be an essential element of their narrative,
to trace the rise and progress of this esoteric doctrine. Thus the learned and amiable
Dr. Jost devotes seventeen pages, in his history of the Jews, to this theosophy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16067src" href="#xd31e16067">56</a>
</p>
<p>1863. No one, however, has prosecuted with more thoroughness, learning and impartiality
the doctrines, origin and development of this esoteric system than the historian Dr.
Graetz. He, more than any of his predecessors since the publication of Landauer’s
literary remains, has in a most masterly manner carried out the principle laid down
by this deceased scholar, and has distinguished between mysticism and the Kabbalah.
Graetz has not only given a most lucid description of the doctrines and import of
the Kabbalah in its original form, but has proved to demonstration, in a very elaborate
treatise, that Moses de Leon is the author of the <i>Sohar</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16077src" href="#xd31e16077">57</a> Whatever may be the shortcomings of this portion <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>of Graetz’s history, no one who studies it will fail to learn from it the true nature
of this esoteric doctrine.
</p>
<p>1863. Leopold Löw, the chief Rabbi of Szegedin, whose name has already been mentioned
in connection with Ignatz Stern, published a very lengthy review of Graetz’s description
of the Kabbalah. Though the Rabbi laboured hard to shake Dr. Graetz’s position, yet,
with the exception perhaps of showing that the Kabbalah was not invented in opposition
to Maimonides’ system of philosophy, the learned historian’s results remain unassailed.
Moreover, there is a confusion of mysticism with the Kabbalah through many parts of
Dr. Löw’s critique.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16086src" href="#xd31e16086">58</a>
</p>
<p>We are not aware that anything has appeared upon this subject since the publication
of Graetz’s researches on the Kabbalah and Löw’s lengthy critique on these researches.
Of course it is not to be supposed that we have given a <i>complete</i> history of the Literature on this theosophy; since the design of this Essay and the
limits of the volume of “the Literary and Philosophical Society’s Transactions,” in
which it appears, alike preclude such a history. This much, however, we may confidently
say, that nothing has been omitted which essentially bears upon the real progress
or development of this esoteric doctrine.
</p>
<p>Several works, in which lengthy accounts of the Kabbalah are given, have been omitted,
because these descriptions do not contribute anything very striking in their treatment
of the Kabbalah, nor have they been the occasion of any remarkable incidents among
the followers of this system.
</p>
<p>Among the works thus omitted are Buddeus’ <i>Introduction to the History of Hebrew Philosophy</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16106src" href="#xd31e16106">59</a> Basnage’s <i>History of the Jews</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16113src" href="#xd31e16113">60</a> where a very lengthy account is given of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>Kabbalah, without any system whatever, chiefly derived from the work of Kircher; Wolfs
account of the Jewish Kabbalah, given in his elaborate Bibliographical Thesaurus of
Hebrew Literature, where a very extensive catalogue is given of Kabbalistic authors;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16121src" href="#xd31e16121">61</a> and Molitor’s <i>Philosophy of History</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16131src" href="#xd31e16131">62</a>
</p>
<p>We sincerely regret to have omitted noticing Munk’s description of the Kabbalah.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e16140src" href="#xd31e16140">63</a> For, although he does not attempt to separate the gnostic from the mystical elements,
which were afterwards mixed up with the original doctrines of this esoteric system,
yet no one can peruse the interesting portion treating on the Kabbalah and the <i>Sohar</i> without deriving from it information not to be found elsewhere.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
